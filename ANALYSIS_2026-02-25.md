# TL;DR

## What Changed Since Last Report (Feb 23 vs Feb 25)

| Change | Feb 23 | Feb 25 | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Signals (missed 0) | 5 | **3** | -2 signals lost (CRM, ADBE recovered above RSI 30; DSY.PA dropped) |
| Near-misses (missed 1) | 107 | **109** | +2 near-misses gained |
| Stress tested | 6 | **8** | 3 signals + 5 nearest near-misses |
| Asymmetric Opportunities | 3 | **3** | 6098.T, 0700.HK, NTES (all new names) |
| Value Traps | 0 | **0** | No value traps identified |
| Wait & See | 3 | **5** | BC8.DE, INFY, WIT, MSFT, 9999.HK |

### Signal Composition Changes (Feb 23 → Feb 25)

| Stock | Feb 23 | Feb 25 | Why |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|
| **CRM** | Signal (RSI 28.4) | **Gone** (not in missed-0 or missed-1 at RSI <30) | RSI recovered post-earnings |
| **ADBE** | Signal (RSI 29.1) | Near-miss (RSI 32.9) | RSI recovered above 30 |
| **DSY.PA** | Signal | **Gone** | Dropped from signal list |
| **BC8.DE** | Signal | **Signal** | Still oversold (RSI 24.5) |
| **INFY** | Not signal | **Signal** | NEW — RSI 28.8 |
| **WIT** | Not signal | **Signal** | NEW — RSI 27.7 |
| **6098.T** | Signal (RSI 28.8) | Near-miss (RSI 31.5) | RSI ticked above 30 |

**Key insight:** The SaaSpocalypse sell-off is easing for US enterprise SaaS (CRM, ADBE bouncing), but the sell-off has rotated into Indian IT services (INFY, WIT) where AI disruption fears are now the dominant narrative. BC8.DE remains stubbornly oversold ahead of its March 20 earnings. Chinese gaming (NTES/9999.HK, 0700.HK) is deeply oversold following Q4 earnings misses and geopolitical headwinds -- but fundamentals remain strong.

### Recommendations

**AVOID:** None -- no stock was rated Value Trap.

**WATCHLIST (Wait & See -- monitor for catalysts before entry):**

1. **BC8.DE (Bechtle)** -- 62% confidence. Record Q4 but supply chain warning from CEO. Earnings growth only 3% vs sector 9.5%. Wait for **March 20** FY2025 final results + 2026 guidance. Buy below €30 if guidance shows 5%+ EBT growth.

2. **INFY (Infosys)** -- 68% confidence. Pristine cash flows ($4.1B FCF, 32.7% ROE), but AI disruption to labor arbitrage model is real and insiders are selling. Revenue growth guided 0-3%. Wait for **April 2026** Q4 FY26 earnings + FY27 guidance. Re-evaluate if FY27 CC growth guided 5%+.

3. **WIT (Wipro)** -- 68% confidence. Cheapest Indian IT major at 15.3x P/E, strong cash conversion (146%), but structurally weakest competitor (lowest margins, lowest revenue/employee). No smart money buying. Wait for **Q4 FY26 earnings (April)** and two consecutive quarters of deal booking growth.

4. **MSFT (Microsoft)** -- 62% confidence. Widest moat in enterprise software, near decade-low P/E of ~24x, but $150B annualized capex creates FCF uncertainty. Director Stanton bought $2M at $397. Wait for **late April** Q3 FY2026 earnings for capex visibility. July 1 M365 price hike (13-17%) is a major pricing power catalyst.

5. **9999.HK (NetEase HK)** -- 68% confidence. Same company as NTES, RSI 30.3 (missed signal by 0.3!). Essentially the same thesis as NTES below but the HK listing is slightly more oversold. Consider this listing if you have HK market access.

**ACTIONABLE (Asymmetric Opportunities -- favorable risk/reward setups):**

1. **6098.T (Recruit Holdings)** -- 72% confidence. Owner of Indeed + Glassdoor. Textbook cyclical dip being priced as structural. 600B+ yen annual FCF with 148% cash conversion. Management buying back 700B+ yen worth of stock (7-8% of market cap). P/E at ~20x vs 10-year median of 30-35x. Hiring markets are cyclical and will recover. **Catalyst: May 2026 FY2025 earnings + FY2026 guidance.** Position: 2-3% starter now, add on hiring market inflection signals.

2. **0700.HK (Tencent)** -- 72% confidence. 1.4B WeChat MAU, 15% revenue growth, 18% profit growth, HK$102B net cash, $80B buyback program. Trading at 15x forward P/E -- a 23% discount to 10-year average. AI infrastructure gap is real but addressable (H200 chip access approved). **Catalyst: March 18 Q4 earnings (3 weeks away).** Position: half position now, add on earnings confirmation.

3. **NTES (NetEase)** -- 72% confidence. Cheapest profitable large-cap gaming stock globally at 15x P/E. $15B net cash (25% of market cap), FCF exceeds net income every year, $5B buyback program. Q4 miss was deferred revenue timing, not demand deterioration. Marvel Rivals + Blizzard pipeline provide multiple catalysts. **Catalyst: May 2026 Q1 earnings (deferred revenue unwind).** Position: 2-3% allocation, add on Q1 confirmation.

### If Forced to Pick One Right Now

**6098.T (Recruit Holdings)** at ¥6,290 with 72% Asymmetric Opportunity confidence.

The case:
- **Textbook cyclical misread:** The hiring market is frozen, not dead. Hiring markets have always recovered. Indeed job postings at 2017 levels = cyclical trough, not structural death
- **Exceptional cash flow quality:** 600B+ yen FCF, 148% cash conversion ratio -- among the cleanest in global staffing/tech
- **Management conviction:** 700B+ yen buybacks in 12 months (7-8% of market cap) -- one of the most aggressive capital return programs in Japanese corporate history
- **Deep discount:** ~20x P/E vs 30-35x 10-year median = 40% below historical average
- **AI as tailwind:** Recruit owns the largest proprietary hiring dataset globally (Indeed + Glassdoor). AI enhances matching, doesn't replace it
- **No imminent binary risk:** Next earnings in May, giving time to build position

The key risk is timing -- the hiring market could stay frozen for another 6-12 months. But with 148% cash conversion and massive buybacks, you're paid to wait.

**Comparison to Feb 23 pick:** Feb 23 recommended MSFT ($397). MSFT has dipped further to $389 but capex concerns have intensified. 6098.T offers a cleaner cyclical-recovery thesis without the AI capex uncertainty -- you're betting on the labor market normalizing, which has a 100% historical base rate.

## Individual Stress Test Reports

<details>
<summary>6098.T -- Recruit Holdings (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. (6098.T) -- ¥6,290

**Near-Miss: Missed 1/4 (RSI 31.5) | P/E ~20x | ROE 27.7% | FCF Conversion 148%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
70% cyclical mispricing / 15% AI structural concern / 10% Japan macro / 5% permanent impairment. Down ~32% from recent highs. The global labor market is in a "low hire, low fire" freeze -- Indeed job postings at 2017 levels. This directly compresses HR Technology revenue. But hiring markets are inherently mean-reverting.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: AI-native job matching platforms bypass job boards; Indeed becomes obsolete. Bull: Indeed's proprietary dataset becomes the training ground for the world's best talent-matching AI; European digital labor shortage makes Recruit indispensable. Multi-bagger scenario has stronger structural backing (25% probability vs 5% zombie).

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Indeed has 250M+ monthly unique visitors creating unassailable demand-side network effects. 10% price increase would see 85-90% retention. LinkedIn is stronger in white-collar; Recruit dominates blue-collar/volume. Vastly superior to traditional staffing peers (Randstad, Adecco).

**4. Valuation Reality:**
~20x P/E vs 30-35x 10-year median -- 40% below historical average. Earnings expanding despite flat revenue (margin improvement). Forward P/E ~18x on consensus FY2027 EPS. Genuinely undervalued on through-cycle basis.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Exceptional. FCF/Net Income ratio of 144-154% over past 3 years. CapEx trivially small (<25B yen vs 600B+ operating cash flow). Capital-light business masquerading as an industrial.

**6. Smart Money:**
700B+ yen in buybacks over 12 months -- management screaming "undervalued." No insider selling during 32% drawdown. Analyst consensus: 0 sell, 10 buy, 6 strong buy. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan bullish.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **May 2026: FY2025 full-year results + FY2026 guidance.** If hiring market stabilization signals emerge and guidance is constructive, stock re-rates aggressively.
- **Q2-Q3 2026: US hiring market inflection.** Pent-up demand from 18+ months of hiring suppression could trigger sharp rebound.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: 20x P/E premium to staffing peers; AI will bypass job boards; LinkedIn's Microsoft-backed AI resources dwarf Recruit's. Activist pitch: World's most profitable HR tech platform, 600B+ yen FCF, 148% cash conversion, at multi-year low during cyclical trough with 700B+ yen buybacks. **Activist pitch is structurally stronger.**

**9. Verdict: Asymmetric Opportunity (72%).** 2-3% portfolio position. Add on hiring market confirmation or further dip to ¥5,500-5,800.

<details>
<summary>0700.HK -- Tencent (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Tencent Holdings Limited (0700.HK) -- HK$522.50

**Near-Miss: Missed 1/4 (RSI 31.9) | P/E ~20.9x trailing, ~15.1x forward | Net Cash RMB 102B**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
65% temporary mispricing / 20% structural (AI lag) / 15% geopolitical tail risk. Down ~11% YTD. Three drivers: (1) AI perception gap (Yuanbao distant 3rd behind ByteDance/DeepSeek), (2) debunked VAT tax rumor caused 6% single-day drop, (3) Pentagon military company designation. Core business growing 15% revenue, 18% profit.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: AI infrastructure gap proves fatal; Beijing regulatory crackdown 2.0; WeChat stagnates as younger users migrate. Bull: 1.4B WeChat MAU becomes the distribution platform for AI services; international gaming (43% YoY growth) becomes $30B+ stream; aggressive buybacks compress share count. Bull scenario ~3x more probable than bear.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
WeChat is the de facto operating system for Chinese digital life. 1.4B MAU with extremely high switching costs (entire social/payment/commerce life embedded). If prices raised 10%: gaming moderate-strong retention, advertising strong retention, fintech weak (Alipay substitute). Widest moat in Chinese tech.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
20.9x trailing P/E vs 27.3x 10-year average (23% discount). Forward P/E 15.1x for a 15-18% earnings grower = PEG ~0.9x. The "E" is high quality and expanding: gaming +15%, international gaming +43%, advertising growing, fintech growing. Genuinely cheap.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
FCF/Net Income ratio of 135-174% over past 3 years -- exceptional. FCF consistently exceeds reported earnings. Net cash of RMB 102B ($14.2B). Fortress balance sheet. Rising AI capex is a watch item.

**6. Smart Money:**
$80B buyback program (largest ever). Management buying at HK$583-596 -- above current price. 47/51 analysts rate Buy/Strong Buy. Prosus selling (~23% stake) creates known overhang but is systematic and priced in.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **March 18: Q4 2025 earnings (3 weeks away).** Market watching AI capex trajectory, gaming momentum, buyback acceleration.
- **Next 3-6 months: Nvidia H200 chip access.** If Tencent secures meaningful GPU allocation, AI lag narrative collapses.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: AI laggard with GPU deficit; Pentagon designation signals broader Western decoupling; Prosus creates relentless selling pressure. Activist pitch: 15x forward P/E, 15-18% earnings growth, $80B buyback, RMB 102B net cash, 1.4B captive users -- capital return machine valued like a utility. **Activist pitch materially stronger.**

**9. Verdict: Asymmetric Opportunity (72%).** 3-5% position. Half now, add on March 18 earnings confirmation.

<details>
<summary>NTES -- NetEase (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### NetEase Inc (NTES) -- $117.18

**Near-Miss: Missed 1/4 (RSI 32.1) | P/E ~15.2x | Net Cash $15B+ | FCF Conversion 110-126%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
75% temporary (Q4 cost front-loading + earnings miss overreaction) / 15% structural (gaming competition) / 10% China regulatory risk. Q4 EPS missed by 22.5% but full-year gaming revenue grew 10% YoY to RMB 92.1B. Fantasy Westward Journey hit all-time record revenue AND DAU. The miss was driven by Marvel Rivals launch marketing costs, investment losses, and tax rate normalization.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: Beijing reimposed crushing gaming regulations; miHoYo and Tencent out-innovate; legacy franchises die. Bull: Marvel Rivals becomes sustained global franchise; AI cuts development costs; global revenue reaches 40%+ of total; buybacks compress share count by 30%+. Multi-bagger 5x more probable than zombie given $15B cash pile and 27-year track record.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Moderate moat. Pricing power is IP-dependent -- strong for legacy franchises (Fantasy Westward Journey: 23 years old, still record highs), moderate for new titles. Lacks Tencent's distribution ecosystem but compensates with IP diversity and proven hit-making ability. Superior to miHoYo on portfolio breadth.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
15.2x trailing P/E vs 10-year median ~19.3x (21% discount). Cash-adjusted P/E ~10-11x. Cheapest profitable large-cap gaming stock globally. The "E" is high-quality: 82% from gaming (recurring live-service), Q4 miss explained by deferred revenue mechanics. Contract liabilities surged 34% YoY -- bullish forward indicator.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
FCF has exceeded net income every year for 3+ years (110-126% conversion). $15B+ net cash = ~25% of market cap. FCF per share growing 16-18% annually. Pristine.

**6. Smart Money:**
CEO William Ding holds 46% stake -- maximally aligned. $5B buyback program ($2B already deployed). Citi raised target to $165 on day of Q4 miss. Institutional flows mixed but major value holders (Dodge & Cox, Hillhouse) maintaining. Governance yellow flag: 2024 corruption scandal.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **May 2026: Q1 2026 earnings.** If deferred revenue unwinds as expected, sharp earnings rebound. Q4 miss narrative collapses.
- **H1-H2 2026: Game pipeline.** Sea of Remnants, MARVEL Mystic Mayhem, Blizzard co-developed mobile titles for China.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: One-dimensional China gaming company; 23-year-old core franchise will eventually die; Beijing can nuke sector with one announcement; governance issues. Activist pitch: 15x PE, $15B net cash (25% of market cap), 110%+ FCF conversion, CEO owns 46%, $5B buyback -- world-class gaming company priced like declining commodity business. **Activist pitch structurally stronger -- facts beat fears.**

**9. Verdict: Asymmetric Opportunity (72%).** 2-3% position. Buy half now, add on Q1 2026 earnings confirmation.

<summary>BC8.DE -- Bechtle (Wait & See, 62%)</summary>

### Bechtle AG (BC8.DE) -- €32.42

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 24.5 | P/E 19.0 | P/B 2.1 | ROE 11.2% | D/E 37%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
65% temporary/cyclical / 20% valuation normalization / 15% structural (IT distribution margin compression). Down ~53% from 2021 ATH. Record Q4 2025 (business volume +16%, EBT +20%) but CEO warned about manufacturer price increases and supply constraints for 2026. Market punished forward caution, not backward results.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: Hyperscale cloud vendors move into managed services; AI automation reduces consulting hours; acquisition goodwill impaired. Bull: European digital sovereignty push creates massive demand for local IT partners; Vision 2030 target of €10B revenue reached ahead of schedule; managed services margins expand to 8%+. Bull more probable given 70+ system houses and local Mittelstand relationships.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Narrow moat based on local system-house network -- physical proximity and trust with German mid-market. No pricing power on hardware (commodity), moderate on managed services. Computacenter stronger with large enterprises; CANCOM more cloud-focused. Moat real but not widening.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
19x P/E vs 10-year average 24.4x (lower third of range). Below history but at premium to Computacenter (15x). Earnings growth only 3% CAGR vs sector 9.5%. Modestly undervalued, not deeply cheap. The "E" is stable but not expanding meaningfully.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Strong. FCF/Net Income ~1.1-1.2x. Capital-light business. Operating cash flow improved dramatically from 2022 to 2024. Dividend well-covered (29% payout ratio). Real cash, no leakage.

**6. Smart Money:**
Karin Schick-Krief (founding family) holds 33% -- long-term aligned. No insider selling during decline (positive). No insider buying signal either. CEO transition (Ebert succeeding Olemotz) adds uncertainty.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **March 20: FY2025 final results + 2026 guidance.** If management confirms Q4 momentum and guides 5-10% growth, stock re-rates from oversold levels.
- **H1 2026: Supply chain / tariff developments.** Windows 10 end-of-support refresh cycle could be demand catalyst.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: Low-growth IT distributor at 19x with 3% earnings growth; secular margin compression as vendors go direct; premium to Computacenter unjustified. Activist pitch: Last-mile IT infrastructure for German Mittelstand at 5-year low; founding family 33% stake; managed services pivot + European AI/cloud spending is multi-year tailwind. **Activist pitch stronger -- but narrowly.**

**9. Verdict: Wait & See (62%).** Wait for March 20 earnings + guidance. Buy below €30 if guidance confirms growth inflection.

</details>

<details>
<summary>INFY -- Infosys (Wait & See, 68%)</summary>

### Infosys Limited (INFY) -- $13.84

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 28.8 | P/E 18.0 | P/B 6.1 [exempt] | ROE 32.7% | D/E 11%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
45% temporary macro / 40% legitimate structural transition (AI compression of labor arbitrage) / 15% permanent impairment. Nifty IT index down ~32% from Dec 2025 peak -- steepest drawdown since 2008 Lehman crisis. AI coding agents threatening 25-30% of traditional IT services work. FY26 guidance revised down to 0-3% CC growth.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bankruptcy probability: ~1% (fortress balance sheet, $4.2B cash, D/E 11%). Multi-bagger probability: ~15% (requires AI fears overblown + macro recovery). Most likely: muddle-through as company transitions from labor arbitrage to AI-enabled services over 2-3 years.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Weak and deteriorating. Historical moat was cost arbitrage (Indian engineers at 30-50% discount), now threatened by AI agents. TCS has deeper banking relationships; Accenture is higher up the value chain. Revenue per employee lags peers. Not a moat business.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
18x P/E vs 10-year median ~22.7x (23rd percentile of range). 36% discount to peer median of ~30x. But the "E" is at risk -- if AI removes 10-12% of revenues and margins compress from 21% to 18%, the "cheap" 18x becomes 21-22x on trough earnings.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
This is the crown jewel. FY2025 FCF $4.1B (record, +41.8% YoY). FCF/NI consistently above 100%. Capital return: 85% of FCF to shareholders. Cash machine with no accounting games.

**6. Smart Money:**
Insiders net sellers (INR 385M sold, zero buys in 90 days). Jefferies downgraded in Feb 2026. Institutional ownership neutral. No conviction from smart money. Buyback is the only positive signal.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **April 2026: Q4 FY26 earnings + FY27 guidance.** If FY27 CC growth guided 4-6% and AI revenue contribution rises from 5.5% to 8%+, narrative shifts.
- **H2 2026: AI revenue inflection.** 4,600+ active AI projects + Anthropic/Nvidia partnerships need to show revenue materialization.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: AI is structural deflationary force on labor arbitrage; 0-3% growth; insiders selling; "cheap" P/E is trap because "E" will erode. Activist pitch: $4.1B FCF machine, 32.7% ROE, 11% D/E, 28% discount to own history -- generational entry if AI fears overblown. **Short pitch structurally stronger in medium term (12-24 months); activist stronger on 3-5 year horizon.**

**9. Verdict: Wait & See (68%).** Do NOT buy today. Set alert at $12.00-12.50. Re-evaluate after April 2026 Q4 FY26 earnings.

<details>
<summary>WIT -- Wipro (Wait & See, 68%)</summary>

### Wipro Limited (WIT) -- $2.14

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 27.7 | P/E 15.3 | P/B 2.3 | ROE 15.2% | D/E 22%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
55% cyclical headwind / 30% structural share loss / 15% GenAI disruption. CC IT services revenue declined 1.2% YoY. Net profit fell 7%. Deal bookings down 5.7% YoY, large deals down 8.4%. Stock is oversold but this is "buying the dip on the weakest horse in the race."

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Zombie scenario significantly more probable (60/40) than multi-bagger. Wipro has attempted multiple strategic pivots over the past decade and each time reverted to being the #4-5 Indian IT player. Multi-bagger requires outexecuting TCS and Infosys -- a bet against base rates.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Weak. Lowest revenue/employee ($45,812 vs TCS $49,600, Infosys $59,856). Lowest margins (17.6% vs TCS ~25%). Competes largely on price. In a commoditizing industry, being the lowest-margin player is dangerous.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
15.3x P/E vs 10-year median 18.8x (18% below). 40-45% discount to TCS/Infosys. But this discount is persistent and arguably deserved given inferior growth, margins, and scale. The "E" is declining (net profit -7% YoY, deal bookings falling). P/E trap risk.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Genuinely strong -- the single best attribute. Operating CF/NI of 120-147%. FCF comfortably covers dividend. Cash conversion is excellent. This is not an earnings fabricator.

**6. Smart Money:**
No conviction. Insiders not buying. Only 2.4% institutional ownership (ADR). Premji family holds 72.66% as legacy holding. No accumulation narrative.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **April 2026: Q4 FY26 earnings.** If guidance surprise + deal booking recovery, modest re-rating. Bar is low.
- **H1 FY27: AI operating model traction.** January 2026 consulting-led model launch needs to show client adoption.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: Structurally weakest Indian IT firm; declining bookings; GenAI hits commodity players hardest; 72% promoter lock-up prevents activist pressure. Activist pitch: $1.8B+ FCF, 146% cash conversion, 15x P/E, 40% peer discount, RSI 27 = oversold; cyclical recovery + AI360 pivot could drive 30-40% upside. **Short pitch structurally stronger -- competitive disadvantage is decade-long pattern.**

**9. Verdict: Wait & See (68%).** Not high-conviction. Max 1% position if forced. Wait for deal booking inflection (two consecutive quarters of YoY growth). Price target for entry: $1.70-1.80.

<summary>MSFT -- Microsoft (Wait & See, 62%)</summary>

### Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) -- $389.00

**Near-Miss: Missed 1/4 (RSI 31.5) | P/E ~24x | ROE ~34% | D/E ~32%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
70% temporary (capex anxiety valuation reset) / 15% structural (AI spend never generates ROI) / 15% market overreaction. Down ~25% from ATH. Q2 FY2026 results were strong (revenue +17%, operating income +21%, Azure +39%) but $37.5B quarterly capex ($150B annualized) spooked investors. Stifel downgraded to Hold.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bankruptcy: <2% probability. Multi-bagger: moderate probability. More realistic risk is becoming a 10-12% compounder instead of 20%+ -- disappointing but not catastrophic. Microsoft has survived every tech cycle since 1986.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Among the strongest in all of technology. Just announced 13-17% M365 price increase for July 2026 -- second major hike with negligible churn. Switching costs are enormous (Azure AD, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint all deeply embedded). Neither AWS nor Google has Microsoft's dual lock-in (productivity + cloud).

**4. Valuation Reality:**
~24x trailing P/E near 10-year low of 22.6x. PEG ~1.1-1.3x. For a company growing revenue 17% and operating income 21%, this is reasonable-to-cheap. Compares favorably to Apple (28x, 4% growth) and Amazon (35x, 10% growth).

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Base business cash generation excellent (80%+ conversion historically). Risk: $150B annualized capex could compress FCF to $10-20B in FY2026 (from $74B in FY2024). This is the bull/bear fulcrum -- a "J-curve" investment where FCF dips now but should recover as AI revenue scales.

**6. Smart Money:**
Director John Stanton purchased $2M at $397 on Feb 18. Executive selling is routine (comp diversification). Gates Foundation sold 65% -- likely idiosyncratic. 33 analysts consensus "Strong Buy," average target $603 (56% upside).

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **Late April: Q3 FY2026 earnings.** Need to see Azure re-acceleration, Copilot monetization scaling, capex peak visibility.
- **July 1: M365 price increase (13-17%).** Directly adds billions in high-margin recurring revenue. Validates pricing power.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: $150B/year on GPUs while DeepSeek achieves comparable AI at 1/20th cost; Copilot has only 15M seats after 2 years (3.3% conversion); FCF compressing 70-80%. Activist pitch: Decade-low 23x P/E, 17% revenue growth, 21% operating income growth, widest enterprise moat, $625B backlog, July price hike adds $5-8B. **Activist pitch structurally stronger -- short thesis requires multiple things to go wrong that have never gone wrong at Microsoft.**

**9. Verdict: Wait & See (62%).** Build 25-50% starter position. Add aggressively on RSI break below 30 (~$360-370) or strong Q3 earnings.

<summary>9999.HK -- NetEase HK (Wait & See → Asymmetric, 68%)</summary>

### NetEase Inc HK Listing (9999.HK) -- HK$178.30

**Near-Miss: Missed 1/4 (RSI 30.3 -- missed signal by 0.3!) | Same fundamentals as NTES**

This is the Hong Kong listing of the same company analyzed under NTES above. All fundamental analysis is identical. The key difference:

- **RSI 30.3** -- just 0.3 points from triggering a full signal. This is the closest near-miss in the entire scan.
- The HK listing may offer slightly better entry for investors with Hong Kong market access.
- Verdict leans toward Asymmetric Opportunity (same as NTES at 72%) but technically classified as Wait & See at 68% because the RSI threshold was not met.

See NTES stress test above for full analysis. Same catalysts (Q1 2026 earnings in May), same risks (China regulation, governance), same thesis (deferred revenue unwind, game pipeline, $5B buyback).
