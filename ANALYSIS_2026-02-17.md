# TL;DR

## What Changed Today

| Change | Feb 16 | Feb 17 | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Scoring system | Percentage-based (score_pct) | **Missed-count based** (criteria_missed) | Fair cross-sector comparison; "missed 1" = "missed 1" regardless of sector |
| 200-day MA filter | Enabled | **Disabled** | Removed falling-knife filter — stocks below 200d MA now eligible |
| Missing D/E treatment | Free pass | **Failure** | More conservative; missing data = fail |
| Minimum criteria floor | None | **3 criteria minimum** | Prevents degenerate edge cases |
| Signals | 0 | **9** | 200d MA was blocking most signals |
| Near-misses | 38 | **105** | Much larger candidate pool with relaxed criteria |

## Day-Over-Day Changes vs Feb 16

| Metric | Feb 16 | Feb 17 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Signals (missed 0) | 0 | **9** | +9 (200d MA disabled) |
| Near-misses (missed 1) | 38 | **105** | +67 |
| Golden Opportunities | 2 (MRK.DE, 4543.T) | **0** | Bear case question eliminated all |
| Value Traps | 3 (FMG.AX, HAL, PRX.AS) | **8** | Bear case exposed structural risks |
| Wait & See | 5 | **2** | 6098.T, DSY.PA |

**Key shift:** Disabling the 200d MA filter surfaced 9 new signals that were previously blocked. Initial 7-question stress tests returned 8 Golden Opportunities, but adding a dedicated Bear Case question (Q8: "make the strongest short pitch") before the verdict dramatically rebalanced results — dropping all Golden Opportunities to 0 and surfacing 7 Value Traps. The truth likely sits between the two extremes, but the revised verdicts better reflect the genuine risks these dip-buying candidates carry.

### Recommendations

**WAIT & SEE (ranked by confidence — monitor for catalysts before entry):**

1. **6098.T (Recruit Holdings)** — 42% confidence. Indeed.com dominates SMB/hourly hiring. 27.3% ROE, fortress balance sheet (12% D/E). **Bear risk:** Paid job ads down 50% YoY. OpenAI building competing job platform. AI disintermediation could make job boards obsolete like newspaper classifieds. Watch: Two consecutive months of US JOLTS inflection AND proof that AI creates new revenue streams (not just slows decline).

2. **DSY.PA (Dassault Systèmes)** — 38% confidence. RSI 17.8 is capitulation-level. CATIA's aerospace lock-in remains one of the deepest moats in enterprise software. FCF-to-NI conversion 125-160%. **Bear risk:** Record 21% single-day crash in Feb 2026. AlphaValue double-downgrade. Revenue down 4%, licenses down 7%. Cloud transition losing to Siemens and PTC. Watch: Cloud ARR re-acceleration above 20% growth (Q2-Q3 2026) to confirm inflection.

**AVOID (Value Traps — ranked by conviction, stay away until thesis changes):**

1. **EVD.DE (CTS Eventim)** — 85% Value Trap confidence (fresh 9Q stress test). Live Entertainment EBITDA crashed 39.7% in H1 2025 despite 6% revenue growth. P/E 31-39x is 70-110% above peer median of 18.5x. CFO quit. No insider buying. EU dynamic pricing ban could halve the multiple overnight. FCF is strong but being incinerated on M&A (See Tickets, France Billet, Arena Santa Giulia). Wait for March 26 earnings — if margins stabilize AND EU regulatory clarity, reassess.

2. **UBSG.SW (UBS)** — 75% Value Trap confidence (fresh 9Q stress test). P/E 21.7x is double the banking sector median of 11.7x and above its own 10-year median of 10.2x. Q4 2025 earnings missed by 31.7%. Operating cash flow collapsed 96% YoY. $26B in new Swiss capital requirements incoming. $32B cumulative litigation exposure from CS legacy. Goldman Sachs downgraded to Neutral. No insider buying. Wait for April 29 Q1 earnings AND Swiss capital requirement final legislation before even considering.

3. **CRM (Salesforce)** — 72% Value Trap confidence. Revenue deceleration to 8.6%, Agentforce pricing chaos (switched models twice), 1,000+ layoffs. AI agents from OpenAI/Microsoft could disintermediate the CRM middleware layer entirely within 24 months.

4. **0700.HK (Tencent)** — 45% Value Trap confidence. AI laggard (#3 behind ByteDance/DeepSeek despite massive spending). Gaming revenue stalled YoY. Down 11% YTD on AI/tax fears. 91% China revenue concentration = unhedgeable policy risk.

5. **HEI.DE (Heidelberg Materials)** — 45% Value Trap confidence. EU emissions policy reversal could strand €1.2B in green bond-funded decarbonization capex. European cement volumes down 20% since 2019. Office construction down 30% from hybrid work shift.

6. **ADBE (Adobe)** — 35% Value Trap confidence. Figma (38% YoY growth), Canva ($42B), and free AI tools are commoditizing creative work from three directions. Institutional investors fleeing (98%+ stake reductions). AI revenue remains "minuscule" per analysts while competitors weaponize AI first.

7. **PRX.AS (Prosus)** — 35% Value Trap confidence. 80% of NAV locked in non-monetizable Tencent stake. -12% earnings growth masked by €3.9B one-time gains. Non-Tencent portfolio is a graveyard of overpaid LatAm/Indian bets. NAV discount is structural, not opportunity.

8. **BC8.DE (Bechtle)** — 35% Value Trap confidence. EPS down 13% over 3 years. Q4 "record" results inflated by DRAM shortage panic buying (demand pull-forward). 4.2% operating margins in a cyclical, low-margin hardware distribution business. German economic weakness.

### If Forced to Pick One Right Now

**Nobody.** This scan produced zero high-conviction buys. Every signal stock carries material structural risks. The two stocks that initially looked most promising (EVD.DE and UBSG.SW) came back as high-conviction Value Traps (85% and 75%) when subjected to a full fresh 9-question stress test.

If absolutely forced at gunpoint: **6098.T (Recruit Holdings)** at 42% Wait & See confidence is the least bad option:

- **Financial quality is genuine**: 27.3% ROE, 12% D/E fortress balance sheet, FCF > net income
- **Cyclical not structural (maybe)**: Indeed's traffic moat is intact, but the job board business model itself is under existential AI threat
- **Management buying back shares** — the only stock in this scan where insiders are acting
- **But**: Paid job ads down 50% YoY is terrifying. At 42% confidence and 22x P/E on negative revenue growth, this is a coin flip, not a conviction call. Wait for US JOLTS inflection AND proof that AI creates new revenue (not just slows the decline).

**Bottom line: Cash is a position. Sitting out this round costs nothing. Getting trapped in a value trap costs everything.**

## Individual Stress Test Reports

<details>
<summary>EVD.DE — CTS Eventim (Value Trap, 85%) — FRESH 9Q STRESS TEST</summary>

### CTS Eventim (EVD.DE) — €65.25

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 26.8 | P/E 31-39x | ROE 29.7% | D/E 11%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Cyclical dip on top of STRUCTURAL MARGIN COMPRESSION. Live Entertainment EBITDA crashed 39.7% in H1 2025 despite 6% revenue growth. "Intense and persistent cost pressures" = they cannot pass costs to consumers anymore. Post-COVID "funflation" spending is wearing off. Artists canceling tours due to poor ticket sales. 30% chance this is structural.

2. **20-Year Survival:** Eventim dies when the EU bans dynamic pricing under the Digital Fairness Act (2027), eviscerating margins. A DOJ-forced Ticketmaster spinoff enters Europe leaner and meaner. Spotify launches "LivePass" — AI-curated blockchain ticketing bundled into Premium subscriptions — capturing 40% of European market by 2042. Eventim, buried under debt from acquisition sprees and legacy venue leases (Arena Santa Giulia white elephant), cannot compete.

3. **Moat Check:** The moat is regulatory capture, not customer love. Eventim has NO pricing power — consumers are in open revolt (Oasis ticketing fiasco triggered UK regulatory investigation, FIFA had to introduce $60 tier after backlash). A 10% fee increase would trigger regulatory intervention, not customer acceptance. Live Nation has stronger vertical integration (owns venues + promoters). SeatGeek has superior UX and transparent pricing — exactly what regulators want.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E of 31-39x is 70-110% above the industry median of 18.5x. You're paying a massive premium for NEGATIVE earnings growth (adjusted EBITDA fell 0.8% in H1 2025). Analyst targets of €103 are lagging indicators based on 2024's record results. If 2025 full-year EBITDA is flat or down, the "cheap" thesis evaporates.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Levered FCF of €827M is strong — but it's all going to M&A, not shareholders. See Tickets (€300M), France Billet, Arena Santa Giulia (€180M). Integration costs bleeding through. Live Entertainment margin collapse of 39.7% suggests these acquisitions are destroying value, not creating it. Dividend yield of 2.34% is pathetic for a stock down 43%.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** ZERO insider buying. The CFO (Holger Hohrein) QUIT — departing year-end 2025, replaced by William Willms. Stock fell 4.5% on the announcement. When the CFO bails at the bottom, that's a red flag. No publicized BlackRock/Vanguard accumulation.

7. **Catalyst:** March 26, 2026 full-year earnings is the only real catalyst. Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics ticketing is a rounding error (€20-50M on €2.8B revenue). Live Nation DOJ settlement is pure speculation. Risk/reward on earnings is terrible: miss = -20%, beat = +10-15% relief rally.

8. **Bear Case:** "CTS Eventim is a margin-compressing, acquisition-addicted, regulatory-threatened rollup trading at 2x its peer group multiple during peak consumer backlash against ticketing fees. Live Entertainment EBITDA collapsed 40% while integration costs explode. The CFO just quit. Dynamic pricing — the only source of margin expansion — is about to be banned across Europe." **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** EU ban on dynamic pricing would re-rate Eventim from "tech-enabled growth platform" (31x P/E) to "regulated utility" (15x P/E) — a 50% drawdown from here.

9. **Verdict:** VALUE TRAP at 85% confidence. You're paying 31-39x for negative earnings growth, margin collapse, an acquisition binge that's destroying value, no insider buying, a departing CFO, and an EU regulatory guillotine hanging over the profit engine. Expected path: €65 → €55 (post-earnings miss) → €45-50 (if EU bans dynamic pricing). Wait for March 26 earnings — if margins stabilize AND EU regulatory clarity, reassess.

<summary>0700.HK — Tencent (Value Trap, 45%)</summary>

### Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) — HK$534.50

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 28.8 | P/E 21.2 | ROE 19.8% | D/E 32%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Temporary dislocation, not structural decline — 15.4% revenue growth and normalized gaming licenses confirm the business is healthy, but the stock will never return to 2021 multiples.

2. **20-Year Survival:** The most likely death scenario (~8-12% probability) is CCP forced restructuring or nationalization of WeChat into a state utility, stripping Tencent of its core asset.

3. **Moat Check:** WeChat's 1.3B-user network effect is the deepest moat in Chinese tech — a 10% fee increase would lose zero users, but the CCP, not the market, is the binding constraint on pricing power.

4. **Valuation Trap:** At 21.2x P/E, Tencent sits at the low end of its post-regulation fair range (18-28x) — slightly cheap but not dirt cheap once you apply the permanent 20-30% China discount.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF converts at 70-80% of net income consistently, balance sheet holds RMB 300B+ in cash, and hidden investment portfolio (PDD, Meituan, Sea, JD) adds hundreds of billions in unpriced value.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Prosus/Naspers remains a persistent structural seller (down from ~29% to ~24-25%), creating an ongoing supply overhang, while Pony Ma and major institutions are holding steady.

7. **Catalyst:** AI monetization breakout in H1 2026 earnings (August report) — if Tencent demonstrates Meta-style AI-driven ad revenue acceleration across 1.3B WeChat users, the multiple expands from 21x to 25-28x.

8. **Bear Case:** Tencent is a documented AI laggard — Yuanbao ranks #3 behind ByteDance and DeepSeek despite burning 1B yuan on cash giveaways. Gaming revenue has flatlined YoY as competition intensifies. Down 11% YTD with HK$173B market cap wipeout on AI/tax fears. **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** 91% China revenue concentration makes it a sitting duck for policy whiplash — one surprise regulatory strike and the stock revisits HK$508.

9. **Verdict:** VALUE TRAP at 45% confidence. The AI lag is quantifiable, gaming growth has stalled, and the regulatory sword of Damocles creates asymmetric downside that capital preservation cannot tolerate.

<details>
<summary>ADBE — Adobe (Value Trap, 35%)</summary>

### Adobe Inc. (ADBE) — $263.97

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 29.9 | P/E 15.8 | ROE 55.4% | D/E 57%**

1. **Falling Knife:** 60% cyclical multiple compression, 40% structural AI disruption concern — not a pure falling knife, but the moat is narrower than five years ago.

2. **20-Year Survival:** Adobe dies if AI commoditizes creative work AND the next generation of designers never adopts Creative Cloud — probability roughly 15-20%.

3. **Moat Check:** Enterprise customers (35% of revenue) would absorb a 10% price hike without blinking; prosumers and freelancers would bleed to Canva and free AI tools.

4. **Valuation Trap:** At 15.8x trailing P/E versus a 10-year average of roughly 35-40x, Adobe is genuinely cheap unless growth collapses below 5%, which current data does not support.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF exceeds net income by 30-65% every year ($8B+ FCF on $6B+ net income) — the cash generation machine is legitimate and arguably the strongest bull argument.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Insiders are not buying at these depressed levels, which is a yellow flag; institutional flows are mixed with value funds accumulating and growth funds trimming.

7. **Catalyst:** March 2026 earnings (Q1 FY2026) where Adobe either proves or disproves that Firefly and AI features are driving incremental ARPU and subscriber growth.

8. **Bear Case:** Adobe's Creative Cloud moat is collapsing as Figma (38% YoY growth) and Canva ($42B valuation) bundle AI-native tools at a fraction of Adobe's pricing. AI from OpenAI/Google/Midjourney commoditizes the very creative output that justified $600/year subscriptions. Institutional investors fleeing (98%+ stake reductions). **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** Adobe becomes the next Oracle — a cash cow legacy vendor with permanent multiple compression as the creative economy unbundles from $60/month suites to $10/month AI apps.

9. **Verdict:** VALUE TRAP at 35% confidence. Three-front war (Figma, Canva, native AI tools) while own AI monetization remains "minuscule." Down 43% in 12 months — this isn't temporary volatility, it's a structural repricing.

<details>
<summary>HEI.DE — Heidelberg Materials (Value Trap, 45%)</summary>

### Heidelberg Materials AG (HEI.DE) — €190.90

**Signal: Missed 0/5 | RSI 29.6 | P/E 18.4 | P/B 2.0 | ROE 11.0% | D/E 48%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Cyclical, not structural — European construction is in a rate-driven downturn, not a permanent decline, and ECB cuts are already underway.

2. **20-Year Survival:** Most likely "death" is acquisition by CRH or Holcim at a 30-40% premium; true equity-to-zero risk is below 10%.

3. **Moat Check:** Real but narrow logistics moat (cement is too heavy to ship far); weaker than Holcim and CRH who have pivoted further into higher-margin downstream solutions.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E of 18.4 is mid-to-upper range for European cement, not distressed — you are paying a fair-to-full multiple on potentially peaking earnings.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Cash is real: 75-95% FCF conversion over 3 years, low maintenance capex, and net debt/EBITDA around 1.0-1.5x.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Merckle family anchor at 28% is not selling; institutional positioning is likely already underweight, meaning the marginal seller may be exhausted.

7. **Catalyst:** ECB rate cuts flowing into a visible inflection in European building permits by Q2-Q3 2026, triggering analyst upgrades.

8. **Bear Case:** Stock collapsed 18.5% since early February when EU signaled it might extend free carbon emissions certificates — eliminating the competitive moat Heidelberg spent billions building through decarbonization. European cement volumes down 20% since 2019 with only 2% annual growth forecast through 2027. Office construction down 30% from permanent hybrid work trends. **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** EU climate policy reversal turning €1.2B in green bond-funded CCUS investments from strategic moat into stranded assets.

9. **Verdict:** VALUE TRAP at 45% confidence. The EU emissions policy reversal transforms this from a differentiated green leader into an overvalued commodity player with stranded decarbonization capex in a structurally depressed market.

<details>
<summary>PRX.AS — Prosus (Value Trap, 35%)</summary>

### Prosus N.V. (PRX.AS) — €42.47

**Signal: Missed 0/5 | RSI 18.6 | P/E 8.7 | P/B 2.0 | ROE 26.0% | D/E 32%**

1. **Falling Knife:** 60% structural (holding-company discount is permanent until restructured) and 40% temporary overshoot (RSI 18.6 is panic-level and almost always mean-reverts within 1-3 months).

2. **20-Year Survival:** Prosus dies if China-West decoupling makes the Tencent stake illiquid and unmonetizable — probability of permanent capital destruction is 35-40%.

3. **Moat Check:** Prosus itself has zero moat; the moat is entirely Tencent's (WeChat monopoly). Every non-Tencent asset — iFood, PayU, OLX — ranges from narrow to nonexistent.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E 8.7 is mathematically real but misleading because it includes Tencent equity-method income that only 10-15% arrives as actual cash; the 40-45% holding-company discount is structural.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Cash conversion is an abysmal 10-20% of reported net income — Prosus receives ~$0.8-1.0B in Tencent dividends against $7-9B in reported earnings. Buyback funded by selling Tencent shares.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Naspers controls 73% so traditional insider signals are muted, but the ongoing $20B+ share buyback program is genuinely accretive and the most shareholder-friendly action management has ever taken.

7. **Catalyst:** Announcement to collapse the Naspers/Prosus dual-listing structure into a single entity, eliminating one layer of discount overnight.

8. **Bear Case:** You're buying a €42 wrapper around a €160B Tencent stake that you cannot monetize without tanking the shares, run by a holding company with a two-decade track record of destroying capital outside that one lucky 2001 bet. -12% earnings growth, statutory profits goosed by €3.9B in one-time gains. New CEO needs to double market cap by June 2028 to collect his €100M bonus — desperation, not conviction. **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** Tencent regulatory shock or forced divestiture that crystallizes the 80% NAV concentration into a total loss, leaving shareholders holding subscale ecommerce assets worth less than the current share price.

9. **Verdict:** VALUE TRAP at 35% confidence. Prosus isn't a "cheap Tencent proxy" — it's a structurally uninvestable vehicle where 80% of value is locked in a geopolitically fragile, non-monetizable asset, and the non-Tencent businesses are value destructive.

<summary>UBSG.SW — UBS Group (Value Trap, 75%) — FRESH 9Q STRESS TEST</summary>

### UBS Group AG (UBSG.SW) — CHF 32.39

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 29.2 | P/E 21.7 | P/B 1.4 | ROE 8.9% | D/E N/A (exempt)**

1. **Falling Knife:** STRUCTURAL, not cyclical. Swiss government proposed $26B in additional capital requirements — a permanent regulatory headwind that fundamentally changes the return profile through 2035. CS client migrations delayed multiple times into Q1 2026, with outflows of former CS clients exceeding expectations. UBS now controls 30-35% of Swiss banking with assets 2.5x Switzerland's GDP — regulators globally are cracking down on "too big to fail." Structural decline probability: 25%.

2. **20-Year Survival:** UBS dies by a kill chain: CS integration drags on hemorrhaging $500B AUM to JPMorgan and Goldman. Swiss regulators impose full $26B capital requirement with no compromise, collapsing ROE to 8%. Fintech/AI robo-advisors disintermediate traditional private banking for clients under $50M. Then a $32B+ cumulative litigation time bomb from CS legacy cases (AT1 bonds, mortgage securities, tax evasion) explodes — courts rule against UBS in multiple jurisdictions. With depleted capital buffers, the bank enters resolution.

3. **Moat Check:** NO moat. If UBS raised wealth management fees 10%, UHNW clients would move to JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, or Pictet instantly. Mass affluent ($1-10M) would switch to Vanguard or Schwab in 48 hours. UBS lags Morgan Stanley and Bank of America in US wealth profitability. The moat is a commoditized wealth platform with worse tech than competitors and a tarnished brand from the CS debacle.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E 21.7x is ABOVE its 10-year median of 10.2x and ABOVE its 10-year mean of 15.3x. It trades at a PREMIUM to the banking sector median of 11.7x — above Citigroup (13x), HSBC (12.8x), and Barclays (7.7x). The "E" is collapsing: Q4 2025 earnings missed by 31.7% (EPS CHF 0.29 vs est. CHF 0.43). Goldman Sachs cut to Neutral, Keefe Bruyette downgraded to Underperform. You're paying 21.7x for earnings that are artificially inflated by purchase price allocation adjustments and under threat from $26B in new capital requirements.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Operating cash flow collapsed from $86B (2023, merger-related) to $3.3B (2024) — a 96% decline. 2024 OCF of $3.3B vs net income of $5.1B = 35% cash conversion. Terrible for a bank. UBS uses "alternative performance measures" to exclude items "not representative of underlying performance" — hiding the real costs of the CS disaster. Cash flow quality is garbage.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** No CEO, CFO, or board member purchases disclosed in the past 6 months. UBS sold its O'Connor hedge fund unit to Cantor Fitzgerald — divesting, not confident in growth. Goldman Sachs downgraded. When your competitors are downgrading you, that's a SELL signal. If the CEO and CFO aren't buying at these levels, why should you?

7. **Catalyst:** April 29, 2026 Q1 earnings is the only catalyst — but given 31.7% Q4 miss, what makes you think Q1 is better? CS integration completion by end-2026 is a "sell the news" event — $13B cost savings already priced in. What's left is $26B in capital requirements kicking in after 2027. There is NO positive catalyst.

8. **Bear Case:** "UBS is a $100B market cap accident waiting to happen, saddled with $32B in litigation liabilities, $26B in looming capital requirements, and a wealth management platform hemorrhaging clients due to botched tech integration. The stock trades at 21.7x P/E — double the banking sector median — for deteriorating earnings quality. Short at CHF 32, target CHF 20 within 18 months." **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** $32B+ cumulative litigation exposure from CS legacy cases. AT1 bondholders are suing for fraud. One black swan legal ruling = down 30% overnight.

9. **Verdict:** VALUE TRAP at 75% confidence. P/E double the sector median, earnings missing by 31.7%, cash flow collapsing, $26B regulatory capital demand, $32B litigation time bomb, no insider buying, Goldman downgrading. There are 500 other financial stocks with cleaner balance sheets, better growth, lower P/Es, and zero integration risk. Wait for April 29 Q1 earnings AND Swiss capital requirement final legislation AND AT1 litigation resolution. Until then, do not touch this.

<summary>6098.T — Recruit Holdings (Wait & See, 42%)</summary>

### Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. (6098.T) — ¥6,114

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 25.1 | P/E 20.6 | ROE 27.3% | D/E 12%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Cyclical, not structural — Indeed's traffic moat is intact but the global hiring market has normalized from post-COVID euphoria, compressing revenue growth from 20%+ to 5.2%.

2. **20-Year Survival (70-75%):** Death-by-AI-disintermediation and a LinkedIn bundling attack funded by Microsoft's balance sheet are the two scenarios worth losing sleep over.

3. **Moat Check:** Strong pricing power in SMB/hourly hiring where no alternative exists at scale; weak pricing power in enterprise/white-collar where LinkedIn competes directly.

4. **Valuation Trap:** At 20.6x earnings, Recruit is 30-35% below its 5-year average P/E and trades at a justified premium to pure staffing peers (12-16x) given its 27.3% ROE and tech platform economics.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF consistently exceeds net income by 10-20%, capex intensity is low at 3-4% of revenue, and the balance sheet is a fortress at 12% D/E.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** No insider selling red flags; management is actively buying back shares at these levels; institutional selling appears mechanical (momentum/redemption-driven) rather than conviction-driven.

7. **Catalyst:** US hiring cycle inflection — when US JOLTS job openings inflect upward for two consecutive months, Indeed's revenue re-accelerates.

8. **Bear Case:** Recruit is a melting ice cube — paid job ads on Indeed are down 50% YoY, HR Technology revenue declining 2.5-7% across recent quarters. OpenAI is building a competing job platform. LinkedIn processes 11,000 applications per minute (up 45% YoY). CEO admits US hiring market will decline another 10% over the next 18-24 months — yet the stock trades at 22x P/E premium despite negative revenue growth. **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** Structural disintermediation of the job board model itself. When 90% of sourcing becomes AI-automated, Indeed's monetization engine loses its economic moat.

9. **Verdict:** WAIT & SEE at 42% confidence. The combination of collapsing paid ad volumes, structural AI disintermediation risk, and a demanding 22x P/E on negative revenue growth makes this a high-risk binary bet. Wait for proof that AI creates new revenue streams, not just slows the decline.

<summary>BC8.DE — Bechtle (Value Trap, 35%)</summary>

### Bechtle AG (BC8.DE) — €32.12

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 18.4 | P/E 18.8 | ROE 11.2% | D/E 37%**

1. **Falling Knife:** 70% cyclical (German IT spending freeze, hardware demand hangover) and 30% structural concern (margin compression in reselling, growth deceleration from 12% to 5%) — RSI 18.4 suggests institutional forced selling, not fundamental collapse.

2. **20-Year Survival (75%):** Bechtle dies by disintermediation — hyperscalers and OEMs sell direct, public sector modernizes procurement, and the middleman reseller model becomes uneconomic.

3. **Moat Check:** Narrow moat — managed services have real switching costs, but the majority of revenue is commodity hardware reselling where a 10% price increase would lose customers within one tender cycle.

4. **Valuation Trap:** 18.8x is a 40-50% discount to Bechtle's 5-year average P/E, but cheap-for-Bechtle is only genuinely cheap if growth re-accelerates above 8%; at 5% growth it is roughly fair.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Surface FCF/net income ratio of ~94% looks healthy, but adjust for 100-200M EUR annual acquisition spending and true FCF to equity drops to 50-60% of net income.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** The Schick family's 35% stake provides genuine alignment; RSI 18.4 is consistent with institutional forced selling rather than informed insider exits.

7. **Catalyst:** German federal government IT modernization budget release (likely Q2-Q3 2026) combined with post-Windows-10 endpoint refresh cycle could add 400-600M EUR in revenue through Bechtle's dominant framework agreements.

8. **Bear Case:** EPS down 13% over three years and full-year 2025 EBT declining 6%. Management warned of supply constraints and manufacturer price hikes squeezing margins throughout 2026. Stock crashed 12% in early February when reality hit. Q4 "record" results were inflated by customers panic-buying PCs ahead of DRAM shortages — demand pull-forward borrowing from 2026 sales. **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** When the DRAM panic-buying hangover hits and conservative guidance disappoints consensus, this stock breaks below €30 as multiple compression meets earnings contraction.

9. **Verdict:** VALUE TRAP at 35% confidence. Decelerating growth in a cyclical, low-margin business during German economic weakness is a recipe for multiple compression, not expansion. The original 62% confidence ignored the -14% profit trend.

<summary>DSY.PA — Dassault Systèmes (Wait & See, 38%)</summary>

### Dassault Systèmes SE (DSY.PA) — €16.07

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 17.8 | P/E 17.9 | ROE 13.3% | D/E 29%**

1. **Falling Knife:** The -4.2% revenue decline and RSI 17.8 capitulation are driven by the 3DEXPERIENCE cloud transition cannibalization compounded by European industrial recession — temporary pain, not terminal disease (70% confidence).

2. **20-Year Survival (75%):** Dassault most likely dies if generative AI renders parametric CAD obsolete and a startup ships an AI-native design tool that makes CATIA's 40-year-old kernel irrelevant.

3. **Moat Check:** CATIA's aerospace lock-in is one of the deepest moats in enterprise software (Airbus cannot switch mid-program on a 20-year aircraft cycle), but SOLIDWORKS faces real erosion from Autodesk Fusion 360 and PTC's Onshape at the midmarket.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E 17.9 is the cheapest DSY has traded in over 15 years (historical range 30-65x), but if revenue keeps declining, earnings compress and that "cheap" 17.9x becomes 21-22x on trough numbers.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF-to-net-income conversion has run at 125-160% for the past three years, consistently exceeding EUR 1B annually — the cash generation is real.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** The Dassault family's 40%+ ownership provides long-term alignment and a floor, but also means no activist can force a strategic correction if the 3DEXPERIENCE bet is wrong.

7. **Catalyst:** Q2 or Q3 2026 earnings report showing cloud ARR re-accelerating above 20% growth, proving the subscription base has reached critical mass — the same inflection that unlocked Adobe in 2013 and Autodesk in 2018.

8. **Bear Case:** Dassault just posted its worst quarter in company history with a 21% single-day crash. Revenue down 4%, software flat, licenses down 7%. Slashed 2026 guidance to 3-5% growth (well below prior 7% annual target through 2029). AlphaValue double-downgraded to Reduce citing "lack of clarity on AI monetization." Underwhelming 6% ARR growth signals losing the cloud transition race to Siemens and PTC. **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** Generative AI and cloud-native competitors will commoditize legacy CAD/PLM workflows faster than management can pivot, causing both a revenue cliff and margin compression.

9. **Verdict:** WAIT & SEE at 38% confidence. The Feb 2026 earnings disaster and double-downgrade revealed execution risk far worse than the original "cloud transition fails to inflect" thesis captured. Need proof of stabilization (Q2-Q3 cloud ARR above 20% growth) before entry.

<summary>CRM — Salesforce (Value Trap, 72%)</summary>

### Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) — $189.72

**Near-miss: Missed 1/4 (P/E 25.3 > 25) | RSI 27.9 | ROE 12.2% | D/E 19%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Not purely temporary — driven by AI cannibalization fears, revenue deceleration to 8.6%, and broad SaaS multiple compression, though the 24% drawdown likely overshoots the actual fundamental damage.

2. **20-Year Survival (80-85%):** Salesforce dies by becoming the next Oracle/SAP — a legacy vendor surviving on switching costs while AI agents erode per-seat pricing and Microsoft bundles eat market share.

3. **Moat Check:** Pricing power is intact for enterprise customers today (95%+ retention on a 10% hike) but narrowing fast at mid-market and SMB where HubSpot and Dynamics offer 50-70% cheaper alternatives.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E of 25.3x is historically cheap for CRM but not cheap for an 8.6% grower — PEG ratio of ~2.2x says this is fairly valued, not a bargain.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Cash generation is the strongest part of the story — 28%+ FCF margins with FCF consistently exceeding net income by 1.5-2x, confirming earnings quality is real.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Zero meaningful insider buying during a 24% drawdown is a yellow flag — the people who know the business best are not pounding the table with their own money.

7. **Catalyst:** Agentforce monetization proof at the next 1-2 earnings reports (late Feb/March and May 2026) — if AI agent revenue hits $500M+ ARR, the stock re-rates 20-30% higher.

8. **Bear Case:** Salesforce is a melting ice cube — revenue growth collapsed to 8-9%, Agentforce pricing whiplash (switched models twice) exposed zero pricing power, and 1,000+ more layoffs while bleeding executive talent. The $2T SaaS sector wipeout in early 2026 signals the market sees disintermediation coming. Microsoft bundles Dynamics + Copilot into existing O365 agreements at a fraction of CRM's $300/seat. **Most dangerous underpriced risk:** Within 18-24 months, enterprises realize they can build custom AI agents via OpenAI/Anthropic APIs or Microsoft Copilot Studio for 90% less cost than Agentforce, collapsing both seat-based AND consumption revenue.

9. **Verdict:** VALUE TRAP at 72% confidence — the strongest conviction bear call in this scan. The SaaS middleware layer is being disintermediated by native AI agents. CRM becomes commoditized infrastructure bundled free into Microsoft 365. Stay away.
