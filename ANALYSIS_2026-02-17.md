# TL;DR

## What Changed Today

| Change | Feb 16 | Feb 17 | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Scoring system | Percentage-based (score_pct) | **Missed-count based** (criteria_missed) | Fair cross-sector comparison; "missed 1" = "missed 1" regardless of sector |
| 200-day MA filter | Enabled | **Disabled** | Removed falling-knife filter — stocks below 200d MA now eligible |
| Missing D/E treatment | Free pass | **Failure** | More conservative; missing data = fail |
| Minimum criteria floor | None | **3 criteria minimum** | Prevents degenerate edge cases |
| Signals | 0 | **9** | 200d MA was blocking most signals |
| Near-misses | 38 | **105** | Much larger candidate pool with relaxed criteria |

## Day-Over-Day Changes vs Feb 16

| Metric | Feb 16 | Feb 17 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Signals (missed 0) | 0 | **9** | +9 (200d MA disabled) |
| Near-misses (missed 1) | 38 | **105** | +67 |
| Golden Opportunities | 2 (MRK.DE, 4543.T) | **8** | New set — different criteria |
| Value Traps | 3 (FMG.AX, HAL, PRX.AS) | **0** | None identified this round |
| Wait & See | 5 | **2** (CRM only true Wait) | Most signals upgraded |

**Key shift:** Disabling the 200d MA filter surfaced 9 new signals that were previously blocked. 8 of the 9 stress-tested stocks (excluding CRM) received Golden Opportunity verdicts with varying caveats. This is a notably more bullish scan than yesterday, but comes with the trade-off of accepting falling-knife risk.

### Recommendations

**WATCHLIST (Golden Opportunities — ranked by confidence):**

1. **EVD.DE (CTS Eventim)** — European ticketing monopoly with 29.7% ROE, 11% D/E, decade-low P/E. FCF exceeds net income. Founder-CEO owns 30%+. Watch: H1 2026 revenue re-acceleration from summer touring season (August earnings).

2. **0700.HK (Tencent)** — WeChat's 1.3B-user moat is impregnable. 15.4% revenue growth, RMB 300B+ cash. Hidden investment portfolio (PDD, Meituan, JD) adds hundreds of billions in unpriced value. Watch: AI ad monetization in H1 2026 earnings (August). **Risk: CCP political risk is binary and unhedgeable. Size accordingly.**

3. **ADBE (Adobe)** — P/E 15.8 vs 10-year average of 35-40x. ROE 55.4%. $8B+ FCF on $6B+ net income. Watch: March 2026 earnings for AI-driven ARPU uplift. **Risk: No insider buying at decade-low valuation is a yellow flag.**

4. **HEI.DE (Heidelberg Materials)** — Cyclical cement downturn, not structural. FCF conversion 75-95%. Merckle family holds 28%. Watch: German building permits turning YoY positive (Q2-Q3 2026).

5. **PRX.AS (Prosus)** — Buying Tencent at 55-60 cents on the dollar. $20B+ buyback program is genuinely accretive. Watch: Naspers/Prosus structural simplification announcement. **Risk: China geopolitical tail risk could strand the Tencent stake.**

6. **UBSG.SW (UBS)** — Only signal stock ABOVE its 200d MA. Normalized P/E likely 11-13x (integration costs suppressing current earnings). Watch: First quarter showing ROE >10% (CS integration proof). **Risk: Swiss capital surcharge uncertainty.**

7. **6098.T (Recruit Holdings)** — Indeed.com dominates SMB/hourly hiring. 27.3% ROE, fortress balance sheet (12% D/E). Watch: US JOLTS data inflection signaling hiring cycle turn.

8. **BC8.DE (Bechtle)** — RSI 18.4 is deeply oversold (institutional forced selling). Germany's #1 IT reseller with 35% Schick family stake. Watch: German federal IT budget release (Q2-Q3 2026).

9. **DSY.PA (Dassault Systèmes)** — RSI 17.8 is capitulation-level. CATIA's aerospace lock-in is one of the deepest moats in enterprise software. FCF-to-NI conversion 125-160%. Watch: Cloud ARR re-acceleration above 20% growth (Q2-Q3 2026).

**WAIT & SEE:**

- **CRM (Salesforce)** — 28% FCF margins are real but revenue deceleration to 8.6% at P/E 25.3x is not cheap. Zero insider buying during a 24% drawdown. Wait for Agentforce ARR proof at next earnings (late Feb / March 2026). Consider entry at $180 on confirmation.

**AVOID (Value Traps):**

_None identified in this scan._

### If Forced to Pick One Right Now

**EVD.DE (CTS Eventim)** at 72% confidence. Here's why:

- **Monopoly economics**: Europe's dominant ticketing platform with network effects and brutal switching costs. Venues complain but renew.
- **Financial quality**: 29.7% ROE, 11% D/E (virtually no debt), FCF exceeds net income by 1.2-1.5x thanks to negative working capital (collect ticket money upfront, pay artists later).
- **Founder alignment**: CEO Schulenberg owns 30%+ — his entire net worth is the ultimate insider signal.
- **Valuation**: P/E 21.8 vs historical range of 30-45x. The discount exists because growth decelerated to 3.5%, but this is a cyclical trough in live event activity, not structural decline.
- **Catalyst**: Summer 2026 European touring season should drive visible revenue re-acceleration in H1 results (August 2026).
- **Lowest geopolitical risk**: Unlike Tencent and Prosus, no China/CCP exposure. Unlike ADBE, no existential AI threat. This is a simple, high-quality business temporarily mispriced.

Runner-up: **ADBE (Adobe)** — 15.8x P/E on a 55% ROE cash machine is rare in mega-cap tech. But the AI disruption uncertainty and lack of insider buying keep it at #2.

## Individual Stress Test Reports

<details>
<summary>EVD.DE — CTS Eventim (Golden Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### CTS Eventim (EVD.DE) — €65.25

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 26.8 | P/E 21.8 | ROE 29.7% | D/E 11%**

1. **Falling Knife:** The drop is driven by post-COVID growth deceleration (revenue growth collapsed from 20%+ to 3.5%), not structural business deterioration — classic multiple compression on a decelerating compounder.

2. **20-Year Survival:** CTS Eventim dies if the EU caps ticketing fees, artists go direct-to-fan at scale, and a tech giant (Amazon/Apple) enters ticketing as a zero-margin loss leader — but probability of actual death by 2046 is only ~8%.

3. **Moat Check:** The moat is wide in continental Europe — switching costs are brutal, network effects are real, and if they raised fees 10% most venues would complain loudly and then renew anyway — but the moat narrows at the borders where Live Nation could invade.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E of 21.8x is cheap relative to CTS Eventim's own decade-long history of 30-45x, but the PEG ratio of ~6.2x at 3.5% growth says it is only genuinely cheap if you believe growth re-accelerates.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF consistently exceeds net income by 1.2-1.5x thanks to negative working capital dynamics (collecting ticket money upfront, paying artists later) — cash generation is real and high-quality.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Founder-CEO Schulenberg owns 30%+ of the company, making his entire net worth the ultimate insider signal — he is a holder, not a trader.

7. **Catalyst:** Summer 2026 European touring cycle should drive a revenue acceleration visible in H1 2026 results around August 2026.

8. **Verdict:** A monopoly-quality business with 29.7% ROE, 11% D/E, and superior cash conversion trading at a decade-low multiple while deeply oversold — buy a 2% position with a hard stop at EUR 52.

<details>
<summary>0700.HK — Tencent (Golden Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) — HK$534.50

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 28.8 | P/E 21.2 | ROE 19.8% | D/E 32%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Temporary dislocation, not structural decline — 15.4% revenue growth and normalized gaming licenses confirm the business is healthy, but the stock will never return to 2021 multiples.

2. **20-Year Survival:** The most likely death scenario (~8-12% probability) is CCP forced restructuring or nationalization of WeChat into a state utility, stripping Tencent of its core asset.

3. **Moat Check:** WeChat's 1.3B-user network effect is the deepest moat in Chinese tech — a 10% fee increase would lose zero users, but the CCP, not the market, is the binding constraint on pricing power.

4. **Valuation Trap:** At 21.2x P/E, Tencent sits at the low end of its post-regulation fair range (18-28x) — slightly cheap but not dirt cheap once you apply the permanent 20-30% China discount.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF converts at 70-80% of net income consistently, balance sheet holds RMB 300B+ in cash, and hidden investment portfolio (PDD, Meituan, Sea, JD) adds hundreds of billions in unpriced value.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Prosus/Naspers remains a persistent structural seller (down from ~29% to ~24-25%), creating an ongoing supply overhang, while Pony Ma and major institutions are holding steady.

7. **Catalyst:** AI monetization breakout in H1 2026 earnings (August report) — if Tencent demonstrates Meta-style AI-driven ad revenue acceleration across 1.3B WeChat users, the multiple expands from 21x to 25-28x.

8. **Verdict:** Golden Opportunity at 72% confidence. Start 3% position, add at HK$480-500, full 7-8% at HK$450. Hard stop on any new CCP structural intervention targeting WeChat. **"The car is fine. The neighborhood is the problem."**

<summary>ADBE — Adobe (Golden Opportunity, 68%)</summary>

### Adobe Inc. (ADBE) — $263.97

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 29.9 | P/E 15.8 | ROE 55.4% | D/E 57%**

1. **Falling Knife:** 60% cyclical multiple compression, 40% structural AI disruption concern — not a pure falling knife, but the moat is narrower than five years ago.

2. **20-Year Survival:** Adobe dies if AI commoditizes creative work AND the next generation of designers never adopts Creative Cloud — probability roughly 15-20%.

3. **Moat Check:** Enterprise customers (35% of revenue) would absorb a 10% price hike without blinking; prosumers and freelancers would bleed to Canva and free AI tools.

4. **Valuation Trap:** At 15.8x trailing P/E versus a 10-year average of roughly 35-40x, Adobe is genuinely cheap unless growth collapses below 5%, which current data does not support.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF exceeds net income by 30-65% every year ($8B+ FCF on $6B+ net income) — the cash generation machine is legitimate and arguably the strongest bull argument.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Insiders are not buying at these depressed levels, which is a yellow flag; institutional flows are mixed with value funds accumulating and growth funds trimming.

7. **Catalyst:** March 2026 earnings (Q1 FY2026) where Adobe either proves or disproves that Firefly and AI features are driving incremental ARPU and subscriber growth.

8. **Verdict:** Golden Opportunity at 68% confidence — 15.8x P/E, 7% FCF yield, and 55% ROE on a still-growing business is a combination the market rarely offers in mega-cap tech. Initiate half position at $264, add on earnings confirmation or capitulation below $230.

<details>
<summary>HEI.DE — Heidelberg Materials (Golden Opportunity, 68%)</summary>

### Heidelberg Materials AG (HEI.DE) — €190.90

**Signal: Missed 0/5 | RSI 29.6 | P/E 18.4 | P/B 2.0 | ROE 11.0% | D/E 48%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Cyclical, not structural — European construction is in a rate-driven downturn, not a permanent decline, and ECB cuts are already underway.

2. **20-Year Survival:** Most likely "death" is acquisition by CRH or Holcim at a 30-40% premium; true equity-to-zero risk is below 10%.

3. **Moat Check:** Real but narrow logistics moat (cement is too heavy to ship far); weaker than Holcim and CRH who have pivoted further into higher-margin downstream solutions.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E of 18.4 is mid-to-upper range for European cement, not distressed — you are paying a fair-to-full multiple on potentially peaking earnings.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Cash is real: 75-95% FCF conversion over 3 years, low maintenance capex, and net debt/EBITDA around 1.0-1.5x.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Merckle family anchor at 28% is not selling; institutional positioning is likely already underweight, meaning the marginal seller may be exhausted.

7. **Catalyst:** ECB rate cuts flowing into a visible inflection in European building permits by Q2-Q3 2026, triggering analyst upgrades.

8. **Verdict:** Initiate 2% position at €190, scale to 3-4% on dip to €170-175, hard stop at €150, target €240-260 over 12-18 months. Risk/reward 1.5:1.

</details>

<details>
<summary>PRX.AS — Prosus (Golden Opportunity, 68%)</summary>

### Prosus N.V. (PRX.AS) — €42.47

**Signal: Missed 0/5 | RSI 18.6 | P/E 8.7 | P/B 2.0 | ROE 26.0% | D/E 32%**

1. **Falling Knife:** 60% structural (holding-company discount is permanent until restructured) and 40% temporary overshoot (RSI 18.6 is panic-level and almost always mean-reverts within 1-3 months).

2. **20-Year Survival:** Prosus dies if China-West decoupling makes the Tencent stake illiquid and unmonetizable — probability of permanent capital destruction is 35-40%.

3. **Moat Check:** Prosus itself has zero moat; the moat is entirely Tencent's (WeChat monopoly). Every non-Tencent asset — iFood, PayU, OLX — ranges from narrow to nonexistent.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E 8.7 is mathematically real but misleading because it includes Tencent equity-method income that only 10-15% arrives as actual cash; the 40-45% holding-company discount is structural.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Cash conversion is an abysmal 10-20% of reported net income — Prosus receives ~$0.8-1.0B in Tencent dividends against $7-9B in reported earnings. Buyback funded by selling Tencent shares.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Naspers controls 73% so traditional insider signals are muted, but the ongoing $20B+ share buyback program is genuinely accretive and the most shareholder-friendly action management has ever taken.

7. **Catalyst:** Announcement to collapse the Naspers/Prosus dual-listing structure into a single entity, eliminating one layer of discount overnight.

8. **Verdict:** Golden Opportunity at 68% confidence — you are buying Tencent at 55-60 cents on the dollar with a real buyback tailwind, but only if you can stomach a 30% overnight drawdown on a China geopolitical headline. Scale in over 4-6 weeks, target €55-60 within 12 months.

<summary>UBSG.SW — UBS Group (Golden Opportunity, 68%)</summary>

### UBS Group AG (UBSG.SW) — CHF 32.39

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 29.2 | P/E 17.8 | P/B 1.4 | ROE 8.9% | D/E N/A (exempt)**

1. **Falling Knife:** RSI 29.2 oversold while holding above the 200-day MA signals a sentiment-driven pullback during the Credit Suisse integration grind, not a broken business.

2. **20-Year Survival (~70%):** UBS most likely dies by regulatory suffocation — Switzerland slowly strangles its only global bank with capital requirements until ROE becomes utility-grade.

3. **Moat Check:** UHNW switching costs are the real moat (not the brand), and 90% of top-tier clients would stomach a 10% fee hike, but lower wealth tiers are increasingly exposed to digital fee compression.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E 17.8 looks fair-to-expensive on trailing numbers but is misleading — integration costs are suppressing earnings, and normalized P/E is likely 11-13x, which is genuinely cheap for a $4T wealth platform.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Dividend is safe at ~30-40% of normalized earnings, but the buyback — the real shareholder return lever — is hostage to Swiss regulatory capital buffer decisions.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** No insider selling red flags; GIC (Singapore sovereign wealth fund) remains anchored at 5-7%; oversold RSI suggests short-term traders have over-rotated while long-term holders are holding firm.

7. **Catalyst:** Completion of the Swiss IT platform migration plus a quarter showing ROE above 10% would prove CS was accretive, unlocking accelerated buyback announcement and 20-30% re-rating.

8. **Verdict:** Buy 50% at CHF 32.39 on the oversold signal, add 50% on either capitulation (RSI <25) or confirmation (ROE >10%).

<summary>6098.T — Recruit Holdings (Golden Opportunity, 68%)</summary>

### Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. (6098.T) — ¥6,114

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 25.1 | P/E 20.6 | ROE 27.3% | D/E 12%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Cyclical, not structural — Indeed's traffic moat is intact but the global hiring market has normalized from post-COVID euphoria, compressing revenue growth from 20%+ to 5.2%.

2. **20-Year Survival (70-75%):** Death-by-AI-disintermediation and a LinkedIn bundling attack funded by Microsoft's balance sheet are the two scenarios worth losing sleep over.

3. **Moat Check:** Strong pricing power in SMB/hourly hiring where no alternative exists at scale; weak pricing power in enterprise/white-collar where LinkedIn competes directly.

4. **Valuation Trap:** At 20.6x earnings, Recruit is 30-35% below its 5-year average P/E and trades at a justified premium to pure staffing peers (12-16x) given its 27.3% ROE and tech platform economics.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF consistently exceeds net income by 10-20%, capex intensity is low at 3-4% of revenue, and the balance sheet is a fortress at 12% D/E.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** No insider selling red flags; management is actively buying back shares at these levels; institutional selling appears mechanical (momentum/redemption-driven) rather than conviction-driven.

7. **Catalyst:** US hiring cycle inflection — when US JOLTS job openings inflect upward for two consecutive months, Indeed's revenue re-accelerates.

8. **Verdict:** Golden Opportunity for patient capital willing to endure 6-12 months of choppy price action. Risk/reward roughly 1:2 (18% downside stop vs. 30-40% upside target).

</details>

<details>
<summary>BC8.DE — Bechtle (Golden Opportunity, 62%)</summary>

### Bechtle AG (BC8.DE) — €32.12

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 18.4 | P/E 18.8 | ROE 11.2% | D/E 37%**

1. **Falling Knife:** 70% cyclical (German IT spending freeze, hardware demand hangover) and 30% structural concern (margin compression in reselling, growth deceleration from 12% to 5%) — RSI 18.4 suggests institutional forced selling, not fundamental collapse.

2. **20-Year Survival (75%):** Bechtle dies by disintermediation — hyperscalers and OEMs sell direct, public sector modernizes procurement, and the middleman reseller model becomes uneconomic.

3. **Moat Check:** Narrow moat — managed services have real switching costs, but the majority of revenue is commodity hardware reselling where a 10% price increase would lose customers within one tender cycle.

4. **Valuation Trap:** 18.8x is a 40-50% discount to Bechtle's 5-year average P/E, but cheap-for-Bechtle is only genuinely cheap if growth re-accelerates above 8%; at 5% growth it is roughly fair.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Surface FCF/net income ratio of ~94% looks healthy, but adjust for 100-200M EUR annual acquisition spending and true FCF to equity drops to 50-60% of net income.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** The Schick family's 35% stake provides genuine alignment; RSI 18.4 is consistent with institutional forced selling rather than informed insider exits.

7. **Catalyst:** German federal government IT modernization budget release (likely Q2-Q3 2026) combined with post-Windows-10 endpoint refresh cycle could add 400-600M EUR in revenue through Bechtle's dominant framework agreements.

8. **Verdict:** Golden Opportunity for patient capital — scale into 2-3% position at EUR 32, dry powder at EUR 28-29, hard stop at EUR 25, target EUR 42-45 over 12-18 months.

</details>

<details>
<summary>DSY.PA — Dassault Systèmes (Golden Opportunity, 62%)</summary>

### Dassault Systèmes SE (DSY.PA) — €16.07

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 17.8 | P/E 17.9 | ROE 13.3% | D/E 29%**

1. **Falling Knife:** The -4.2% revenue decline and RSI 17.8 capitulation are driven by the 3DEXPERIENCE cloud transition cannibalization compounded by European industrial recession — temporary pain, not terminal disease (70% confidence).

2. **20-Year Survival (75%):** Dassault most likely dies if generative AI renders parametric CAD obsolete and a startup ships an AI-native design tool that makes CATIA's 40-year-old kernel irrelevant.

3. **Moat Check:** CATIA's aerospace lock-in is one of the deepest moats in enterprise software (Airbus cannot switch mid-program on a 20-year aircraft cycle), but SOLIDWORKS faces real erosion from Autodesk Fusion 360 and PTC's Onshape at the midmarket.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E 17.9 is the cheapest DSY has traded in over 15 years (historical range 30-65x), but if revenue keeps declining, earnings compress and that "cheap" 17.9x becomes 21-22x on trough numbers.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** FCF-to-net-income conversion has run at 125-160% for the past three years, consistently exceeding EUR 1B annually — the cash generation is real.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** The Dassault family's 40%+ ownership provides long-term alignment and a floor, but also means no activist can force a strategic correction if the 3DEXPERIENCE bet is wrong.

7. **Catalyst:** Q2 or Q3 2026 earnings report showing cloud ARR re-accelerating above 20% growth, proving the subscription base has reached critical mass — the same inflection that unlocked Adobe in 2013 and Autodesk in 2018.

8. **Verdict:** Golden Opportunity at 62% confidence — risking 25% downside to EUR 12 for 55-85% upside to EUR 25-30. Half position now, half on confirmation.

<details>
<summary>CRM — Salesforce (Wait & See, 58%)</summary>

### Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) — $189.72

**Near-miss: Missed 1/4 (P/E 25.3 > 25) | RSI 27.9 | ROE 12.2% | D/E 19%**

1. **Falling Knife:** Not purely temporary — driven by AI cannibalization fears, revenue deceleration to 8.6%, and broad SaaS multiple compression, though the 24% drawdown likely overshoots the actual fundamental damage.

2. **20-Year Survival (80-85%):** Salesforce dies by becoming the next Oracle/SAP — a legacy vendor surviving on switching costs while AI agents erode per-seat pricing and Microsoft bundles eat market share.

3. **Moat Check:** Pricing power is intact for enterprise customers today (95%+ retention on a 10% hike) but narrowing fast at mid-market and SMB where HubSpot and Dynamics offer 50-70% cheaper alternatives.

4. **Valuation Trap:** P/E of 25.3x is historically cheap for CRM but not cheap for an 8.6% grower — PEG ratio of ~2.2x says this is fairly valued, not a bargain.

5. **Cash Flow Reality:** Cash generation is the strongest part of the story — 28%+ FCF margins with FCF consistently exceeding net income by 1.5-2x, confirming earnings quality is real.

6. **Insider/Smart Money:** Zero meaningful insider buying during a 24% drawdown is a yellow flag — the people who know the business best are not pounding the table with their own money.

7. **Catalyst:** Agentforce monetization proof at the next 1-2 earnings reports (late Feb/March and May 2026) — if AI agent revenue hits $500M+ ARR, the stock re-rates 20-30% higher.

8. **Verdict:** Wait and See — build a position in thirds ($180-190 starter, add after earnings proof, reserve dry powder for $160), hard stop at $145. Wait for Agentforce ARR above $500M before going full position.
