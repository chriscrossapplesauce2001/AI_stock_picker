### Full Stress Test Scorecard (All 11 Signals)

Each signal was run through the 5-question hedge fund manager stress test (stress_test.txt) — a ruthless, skeptical evaluation designed to talk you OUT of the trade before entry.

| # | Stock | Price | Verdict | Conf. | Core Thesis Killer |
|---|-------|-------|---------|-------|--------------------|
| 1 | **WIT** (Wipro) | $2.34 | **VALUE TRAP** | 78% | AI destroying labor arbitrage; $50B wiped from Indian IT sector; net profit fell 7% |
| 2 | **PRX.AS** (Prosus) | €42.51 | **VALUE TRAP** | 72% | 80% NAV = Tencent, which is losing China AI race; permanent holding discount |
| 3 | **DBK.DE** (Deutsche Bank) | €29.60 | **VALUE TRAP** | 72% | HQ raided for money laundering; P/E 7.5 is average for DBK; ROE < cost of equity |
| 4 | **HEI.DE** (Heidelberg Materials) | €188.45 | **VALUE TRAP** | 72% | EU carbon trading thesis blown up by Merz; P/E above 10yr avg |

| 8 | **CRM** (Salesforce) | $189.72 | **WAIT & SEE** | 72% | SaaSpocalypse; but $7B net income, pristine balance sheet. Earnings Feb 25 critical |
| 9 | **PUB.PA** (Publicis) | €72.74 | **WAIT & SEE** | 72% | Best-run agency but peak margins; Meta automating full ad campaigns by 2026 |
| 10 | **DSY.PA** (Dassault) | €17.82 | **WAIT & SEE** | 72% | Record -21% day on AI fears; but sticky aerospace installed base |
| 11 | **4543.T** (Terumo) | ¥1,909 | **WAIT & SEE** | 72% | 15% US tariff headwind; $1.5B OrganOx acquisition risk; but real 12.6% revenue growth |

### Recommendations

#### AVOID (6 Value Traps)

**WIT, PRX.AS, DBK.DE, HEI.DE, BC8.DE, ZAL.DE** — All are cheap for identifiable structural reasons. The scanner correctly flags them as quantitatively attractive, but the stress tests reveal broken or deteriorating fundamentals behind the low metrics.

#### WATCHLIST - Wait for Catalysts (5 stocks, ranked by conviction)

1. **CRM (Salesforce)** — Best risk/reward of all 11. Wait for **Feb 25 earnings**. If FY27 guidance shows 10%+ revenue growth with Agentforce traction and stock stays under $200, it becomes actionable. Pristine balance sheet (D/E 19%), $7B+ net income.

2. **4543.T (Terumo)** — NEW signal. Legitimate medical device franchise with 12.6% revenue growth. Wait for tariff resolution clarity and OrganOx integration progress. Set alert at ¥1,800. 11/11 analysts say Buy with ¥3,000+ targets.

3. **PUB.PA (Publicis)** — Best-run advertising company in the world, real Epsilon data moat, P/E 8.7. Wait for €65 entry (6.5x forward P/E) to get compensated for AI disintermediation risk.

4. **DSY.PA (Dassault)** — Aerospace/auto PLM lock-in is real. Wait for stock to base at €17 for 4-6 weeks, or set alert at €15.50 for a margin-of-safety entry.

5. **UBSG.SW (UBS)** — World-class franchise outside the US. Wait for Q2 Swiss capital requirements decision and US wealth outflow stabilization. Set alert at CHF 28 (near book value).

#### If Forced to Pick ONE Right Now

**None.** But gun-to-head, **CRM after Feb 25 earnings** has the best setup. It's the only stock where the business might actually *become* the AI platform rather than just being disrupted by it.

### Individual Stress Test Reports

<details>
<summary><b>WIT (Wipro) — VALUE TRAP (78% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** AT LEAST 40% structural. The entire Indian IT services sector lost $50 billion in market cap in the first two weeks of February 2026. Anthropic launched automation plug-ins for Claude that can perform in minutes what previously required large engineering teams. Application services account for 40-70% of revenue for Indian IT firms. Wipro sells human hours. AI sells machine seconds. JPMorgan has explicitly flagged that India's IT firms could miss growth targets as AI pushes clients to reallocate spending away from traditional outsourcing.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** Death by a thousand AI agents. 2026-2028: denial phase, revenue flat as clients redirect 10-15% of budgets to AI tooling. 2029-2032: AI coding agents handle 60-70% of Tier 1/2 support, average deal size shrinks 25%. 2033-2037: TCS and Infosys absorb remaining contracts; Wipro, the weakest Big Three player, loses largest clients. 2038-2041: acquired by PE, stripped for parts.

**3. Moat Check:** ZERO pricing power. Wipro's entire value proposition is "we do the same work cheaper because our engineers sit in Bangalore." When your moat is "we are cheap," you cannot raise prices. TCS has 5x scale. Infosys has stronger AI/digital capabilities. Wipro is the smallest and weakest of the Big Three.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E 15.9 on declining earnings is not cheap. Net profit fell 7% YoY in Q3 FY26 even as revenue grew 5.5%. New Indian labour codes adding permanent 5% increase in employee expenses. Q4 guidance: 0-2% sequential growth. Annual revenue declined 3.18%. Allianz dumped 40.7% of its Wipro position.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>PRX.AS (Prosus) — VALUE TRAP (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** STRUCTURAL. You are not buying "Prosus" — you are buying a holding company wrapper around a 23% stake in Tencent (~80% of NAV). Tencent is getting obliterated in the AI race: WeChat's AI chatbot Yuanbao has 20.84M weekly active users vs. ByteDance's Doubao at 155M. Tencent shares down 11% YTD while Alibaba and Baidu have risen on AI momentum. Tax hike rumors adding to pressure.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** Tencent loses AI platform war. WeChat's super-app status erodes. Gaming revenues decline with China's demographic collapse. Prosus sells down Tencent stake to fund buybacks, reducing its claim on the one asset that matters. E-commerce portfolio (iFood, OLX) never achieves enough scale. Holding company discount widens to 60%.

**3. Moat Check:** Prosus has NO moat — it is a financial holding company that does not make or sell anything. Tencent's gaming is hit-driven with zero pricing power. The e-commerce portfolio consists of commodity businesses in brutally competitive emerging markets.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E of 11.1 is a mirage. "E" is heavily influenced by Tencent equity-method earnings and mark-to-market gains. Prosus has traded at 25-50% discount to NAV for its entire existence — the market consistently says the holding structure destroys value. A DCF analysis suggests the stock is 38.9% overvalued. Oddo BHF just downgraded to Neutral.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>DBK.DE (Deutsche Bank) — VALUE TRAP (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** Active law enforcement risk. BKA raided Frankfurt HQ and Berlin offices on January 28, 2026 with 30 investigators. Probe concerns money laundering tied to Abramovich-linked entities. EUR 152M damages trial starts April 2026. Monte Paschi settlement just closed. Chronic compliance disease spanning 15+ years.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** Compliance failures compound into DOJ reopening investigation. ECB rate cycle turns, compressing retail bank NIM. Technology arms race lost to JPMorgan ($17B tech spend vs. Deutsche's ~$4B). European sovereign debt crisis exposes concentrated bond exposure.

**3. Moat Check:** NO meaningful pricing power. Second-tier investment bank competing on price and relationships. JPMorgan is poaching Deutsche's own bankers. Postbank is closing half its branches — a cost center, not a moat. A 10% fee hike would trigger client defections.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E 7.5 is ABOVE the 10-year mean of 5.74. This stock has traded at P/E 3-5 for extended periods. ROE of 8.9% is below cost of equity — the bank is destroying shareholder value. Earnings are at cyclical peak driven by investment banking super-cycle. P/B 0.7 is the market correctly saying this stock should trade below book.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>HEI.DE (Heidelberg Materials) — VALUE TRAP (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** Regulatory thesis implosion. Stock cratered ~18.5% after Chancellor Merz suggested EU should "revise or postpone" Emissions Trading System. Heidelberg received ~€2B in free carbon allowances in 2023 — if ETS is weakened, billions invested in CCUS become stranded capital. Without CBAM teeth, cheap Turkish/Asian cement imports face no carbon border tax.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** ETS diluted, CCUS investments produce captured CO2 nobody wants. German construction crisis deepens (housing completions collapsing). CRH dominates North America, Holcim consolidates Europe. Alternative binders displace Portland cement. Heidelberg becomes subscale European player.

**3. Moat Check:** Cement is a regional oligopoly with local pricing power, but Heidelberg is the most POLICY-DEPENDENT of the Big Three. CRH has dominant US positioning with no carbon regulation drama. Holcim is more agile. Heidelberg's moat is a political bet.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E 13.5 is 40.6% ABOVE the 10-year average of 9.27. Revenue was flat in 2024. Free carbon allowance shrinkage represents -7% earnings headwind. Germany's construction market in freefall. If earnings decline 15-20%, "cheap" P/E becomes 16-17x.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>BC8.DE (Bechtle) — VALUE TRAP (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** BOTH cyclical and structural. Stock dropped ~12% intraday Feb 9 after CEO warned of "significant manufacturer price increases" and guided 2026 EBT growth of 0-5% vs. analyst consensus of +15%. EBIT margins declining four consecutive years (6.0% -> 5.1%). IT reseller model being structurally disintermediated as cloud hyperscalers go direct-to-customer.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** Hardware reselling commoditized as hyperscalers launch direct procurement portals. Managed services pivot comes too late — Accenture, Capgemini, Indian IT giants already locked up enterprise contracts. 30+ years of acquisition-fueled goodwill implodes when relationships expire.

**3. Moat Check:** Essentially ZERO pricing power on core reselling. Customers can buy the same Dell server or Microsoft license from Computacenter, CANCOM, or the OEM directly. Switching costs near zero. Computacenter has scale advantage. CANCOM is more cloud-native.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E 16x is not "cheap" — 10-year low was 13.6x. Management just guided earnings DOWN. If margins compress below 5% and EBT disappoints, stock could fall to €27-28 (15-18% further downside). The scanner sees a cheap stock; the fundamentals show a deteriorating middleman business.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ZAL.DE (Zalando) — VALUE TRAP (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** BOTH cyclical and structural. 49% drawdown from 52-week high. Closing Erfurt fulfillment center (2,700 jobs) plus three more warehouses post-About You acquisition. Shein added 15.2M new monthly users in Europe. Temu entered Top 15 fashion sellers in France. European consumer confidence deteriorating.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** About You integration consumes capital with delayed synergies (not until 2028+). Shein/Temu achieve delivery parity at 30-50% lower prices. Amazon's fulfillment network locks in fashion brands at scale. Zalando's mid-market positioning gets crushed from above and below simultaneously.

**3. Moat Check:** NO pricing power. If Zalando raised commissions 10%, brands redirect to Amazon Fashion and consumers move to Shein/Temu. Partner Program creates some friction for small brands but is entirely replicable by Amazon.

**4. Valuation Trap:** 10-year average P/E is 126-151 (mostly unprofitable history). The market has permanently de-rated this to a mature low-margin retailer. Q3 EBIT margin declined to 3.2% from 3.9%. Revenue growth of 26.5% is mostly the About You acquisition being consolidated. Earnings Feb 26 creates binary event risk — why buy BEFORE the print?

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>UBSG.SW (UBS) — WAIT & SEE (78% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** BOTH. Q4 beat expectations ($1.2B profit, up 56% YoY). But: lost $14B in net outflows from US wealth management in Q4. 132 advisors walked out managing $52B. Goldman and Vontobel downgraded — most bearish analyst consensus since 2017. Swiss government's proposed TBTF capital requirements could force $24B in additional CET1 capital. Credit Suisse client migrations delayed.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** Switzerland imposes punitive capital requirements, compressing ROE permanently to 8-10%. US wealth exodus continues as Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan poach top advisors. AI-driven wealth platforms from fintech/big tech offer 15bps vs. UBS's 75-100bps. European banking consolidation creates scale competitors UBS cannot match.

**3. Moat Check:** Real in Europe and Asia. Eroding in the US — lost $14B in Q4 without a price hike. Morgan Stanley actively raiding UBS teams. Julius Baer positions as pure-play alternative without integration drag.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E 10.5x is the 10-year MEDIAN, not a discount. "E" inflated by one-time integration benefits and negative goodwill from CS deal. Earnings estimates falling (2026 EPS cut from $3.31 to $3.11). ROE 8.9% below cost of equity. P/B 1.4x is generous for a bank earning below cost of equity.

**Wait for:** Q2 Swiss capital requirements decision, US wealth outflow stabilization, CHF 28 entry (near book value).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>CRM (Salesforce) — WAIT & SEE (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** Not purely cyclical — 30-40% structural probability. Down 45% from 52-week high of $347.93. The market is pricing in whether AI agents eliminate the need for $300/seat/month CRM. $300B in SaaS market value evaporated in one week ("SaaSpocalypse"). The value is migrating from SaaS applications to AI infrastructure.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** Agentforce cannibalizes human seat licenses (every AI agent sold replaces 3-5 seats). Microsoft Dynamics 365 with Copilot undercuts on bundling economics. Open-source CRM frameworks emerge on foundation models. Seat-based revenue model collapses.

**3. Moat Check:** Cracking but real. Large enterprises have $500K-$2M switching costs. Mid-market defecting to HubSpot/Microsoft. Microsoft is the real threat — Dynamics 365 with Copilot practically free if you're already paying for Azure/Teams/Office.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E 14.5 looks cheap vs. 10-year average of 97-210x, but that history was a hyper-growth company. Today's CRM grows 8-9%, not 20-30%. Margins at peak from cost-cutting (cannot cut further). Insiders: 189 sales out of 191 transactions, zero purchases. CEO sold $580K in Oct 2025.

**Wait for:** Feb 25 earnings — FY27 guidance, net revenue retention rate, Agentforce unit economics. If revenue re-accelerates above 10% and stock stays under $200, then actionable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>PUB.PA (Publicis) — WAIT & SEE (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** BOTH. Stock dropped ~9% on Feb 3 after net revenue of €14.55B missed consensus. Barclays downgraded. Structural threat: Meta targeting FULL campaign automation by 2026. 60% of US senior marketing leaders said they spent less on agencies in 2025 due to AI.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** Meta's Advantage+ and Google's Performance Max become fully autonomous ad systems. Mid-market advertisers stop using agencies. Large enterprises build in-house AI marketing teams. Omnicom-IPG merger monster engages in price war. Epsilon data asset commoditized by privacy regulations.

**3. Moat Check:** FAILS the 10% test. CMOs would call Omnicom or WPP for a competitive pitch within 90 days. Publicis won twice as many pitches as competitors in 2025 — proving accounts MOVE. Low switching costs. Temporary execution advantage, not a moat.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E 8.7 below 10-year mean of 10.07, but "E" is at a cyclical PEAK. Operating margins at 18.2% are the highest in company history. 2026 guidance decelerating to 4-5% organic growth. Revenue missed Q4. Buying low P/E on peak earnings is the textbook value trap.

**Wait for:** €65 entry (6.5x forward P/E), Q1 2026 results for deceleration confirmation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>DSY.PA (Dassault Systemes) — WAIT & SEE (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** Not purely cyclical — 25-30% structural. Stock cratered 21% in a single session (worst day in company history) on weak Q4 and AI fears. 2026 guidance of 3-5% revenue growth missed every estimate. AlphaValue double-downgraded from Buy to Reduce, axed target to €17.80. Two of three major verticals (auto and life sciences) structurally challenged.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** Subscription transition creates 4-year revenue desert. AI design tools from Autodesk offer "80% of CATIA for 10% of the price." Medidata ($5.8B acquisition) obsoleted by AI-powered clinical trial platforms. Siemens Teamcenter integrates industrial AI copilot. 3DEXPERIENCE platform never solves its "coherence problem."

**3. Moat Check:** Narrowing. CATIA in aerospace has genuine lock-in (~90% retention on 10% hike). SOLIDWORKS (SMB/mid-market) is price-sensitive (~70-75% retention). Medidata clients already leaving. Ranked third behind Siemens and PTC in PLM by ABI Research.

**4. Valuation Trap:** P/E 12.5 vs. 10-year average of 55.5x looks like a steal. But: IFRS EPS was 0.90 vs. non-IFRS 1.31 (45% gap). 2026 guidance implies flat EPS. Revenue growth decelerating (4% -> 3-5%). Software revenue fell 5% in Q4. AlphaValue's new target is literally €17.80 — you'd be buying at fair value per the analyst who just downgraded it.

**Wait for:** Stock to hold €17 for 4-6 weeks, or set alert at €15.50. Q1 2026 results due ~April.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4543.T (Terumo) — WAIT & SEE (72% confidence)</b></summary>

**1. Falling Knife Test:** 70% cyclical, 30% structural. Cyclical: 15% US tariff on Japanese medical device imports eating ~¥17B annual profit; yen weakness; broad risk-off on Japanese equities. Structural: $1.5B OrganOx acquisition (largest ever) on speculative organ transplantation play not approved in Japan. Core cardiovascular business (60%+ revenue) faces Medtronic/Abbott/Boston Scientific pushing AI-integrated surgical systems. ROE 8.7% — cannot consistently hit 10%.

**2. 20-Year Pre-Mortem:** OrganOx misses 2030 commercialization target as market shifts to synthetic organs/xenotransplantation. Medtronic/Abbott integrate AI into surgical guidance, making Terumo's interventional products commodity hardware. Japan's population falls below 100M, shrinking home market. Chinese manufacturers (Microport, Lepu) compete on price.

**3. Moat Check:** Moderate but eroding. High-end interventional cardiology (~30% of revenue) has real physician lock-in. Commodity products (syringes, infusion sets) have zero pricing power — BD dominates with deeper distribution. Medtronic outspends on R&D by 4-5x.

**4. Valuation Trap:** Historical 30-50x P/E was the BOJ zero-rate anomaly; 18-23x is the new normal. Management revised DOWN operating profit guidance (¥194B -> ¥181.5B) and net profit (¥143B -> ¥136B). Net income fell 16.2% QoQ. If EPS comes in at ¥87-90, forward P/E becomes 21-22x. P/B 1.8x is generous for sub-10% ROE.

**Wait for:** Tariff resolution clarity, OrganOx integration progress (mid-2026), stock to test ¥1,800 support. 11/11 analysts say Buy with ¥3,000+ targets.
