# TL;DR

## What Changed Today

| Change | Feb 17 | Feb 18 | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Stress test persona | **Pessimist** (cynical, "talk me out of it") | **Based** (balanced, objective sparring partner) | Dramatically different verdicts — same stocks, different lens |
| Signals | 9 | **9** | Same count, different composition |
| Near-misses | 105 | **104** | Marginal change |
| Golden/Asymmetric Opportunities | 0 | **8** | Based test finds value where pessimist saw only risk |
| Value Traps | 8 | **0** | No stocks flagged as value traps under balanced analysis |
| Wait & See | 2 | **1** | BC8.DE only |

### Signal Composition Changes (Feb 17 → Feb 18)

| Stock | Feb 17 | Feb 18 | Why |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|
| **CRM** | Near-miss (P/E 25.3 > 25) | **SIGNAL** (P/E 24.6) | P/E dropped below threshold |
| **PUB.PA** | Near-miss (RSI 30.2) | **SIGNAL** (RSI 27.5) | RSI dropped below 30 — NEW signal |
| **UBSG.SW** | Signal (RSI 29.2) | Near-miss (RSI 36.6) | RSI recovered above 30 — DROPPED |
| **HEI.DE** | Signal (RSI 29.6) | Near-miss (RSI 39.9) | RSI recovered above 30 — DROPPED |
| ADBE, EVD.DE, BC8.DE, DSY.PA, PRX.AS, 6098.T, 0700.HK | Signal | Signal | Unchanged |

## Day-Over-Day Changes vs Feb 17

| Metric | Feb 17 | Feb 18 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Signals (missed 0) | 9 | **9** | Same count, 2 in / 2 out |
| Near-misses (missed 1) | 105 | **104** | -1 |
| Asymmetric Opportunities | 0 | **8** | Based test surfaces genuine opportunities |
| Value Traps | 8 | **0** | Based test finds no pure value traps |
| Wait & See | 2 | **1** | BC8.DE pending March 20 earnings |

**Key insight:** The switch from the pessimist to the based stress test fundamentally changed the output. The pessimist test asked "talk me out of the trade" and found reasons to reject every stock. The based test asked "what does the data actually say?" and found that most of these stocks are genuinely mispriced by the market — particularly given the February 2026 SaaSpocalypse sell-off that hit software stocks indiscriminately. The truth likely sits between the two extremes. The based test is more useful for identifying asymmetric setups; the pessimist test is more useful for identifying thesis killers.

### Recommendations

**ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITIES (ranked by confidence — favorable risk/reward setups):**

1. **CRM (Salesforce)** — 72% confidence. The strongest setup in the scan. $15B annual FCF at 12x FCF multiple. Margins expanding from 30.5% to 35.5% over 2 years. Agentforce at $500M+ ARR growing 330%. **Binary catalyst Feb 25 (7 days).** The SaaSpocalypse sell-off hit CRM indiscriminately alongside the entire software sector. Position: 50% now, 50% post-earnings.

2. **EVD.DE (CTS Eventim)** — 72% confidence. Europe's dominant ticketing platform at a 43% discount from highs triggered by a CFO change, not fundamental deterioration. EUR 1.19B net cash (19% of market cap backed by cash). Revenue grew 19% in FY2024, 6% in 9M 2025. 25 analysts with unanimous Strong Buy, consensus target €109 (+69% upside). **Catalyst: March 26 earnings + 2026 Winter Olympics.** Position: 50% now, 50% post-earnings.

3. **0700.HK (Tencent)** — 72% confidence. The cheapest large-cap Communication Services stock globally. 21x P/E vs Meta 30x and Alphabet 33x, with comparable margins and growth. AI-driven ad revenue already +21% YoY. Management buying back HK$80B+ annually. **Catalyst: March 17-18 Q4/FY earnings.** Caveat: China political risk is unhedgeable; size at 3-5% max. Position: full but capped.

4. **PRX.AS (Prosus)** — 72% confidence. The most mathematically obvious trade in European equities. $160B of Tencent for $93B, plus a $7B e-commerce portfolio generating positive FCF for the first time since IPO. Buyback has reduced float by 30% since 2022. PEG of 0.65. **Catalyst: FY2026 results June 2026.** Caveat: 80% NAV concentration in Tencent = same China risk. Position: 3-4% max.

5. **PUB.PA (Publicis Groupe)** — 68% confidence. **New signal today.** The sector's best operator hit by an indiscriminate AI panic sell-off on Feb 3 (-9.24%, alongside Omnicom -11%, WPP -10%). 8.1% FCF yield, 5.3% dividend yield, 18.2% operating margin (industry high). Record revenue, record margins, record FCF. **Catalyst: Q1 2026 revenue report April/May.** Position: half now, half post-Q1 report.

6. **ADBE (Adobe)** — 65% confidence. 15.6x P/E is 60% below its 10-year average. $9.9B FCF growing 25% YoY. 41% FCF margins — top tier in software globally. The AI disruption fear is real but premature; Adobe's enterprise lock-in remains deep. **Catalyst: March 11 Q1 FY2026 earnings.** Position: 25-30% starter, add post-earnings.

7. **DSY.PA (Dassault Systèmes)** — 65% confidence. A monopoly-grade PLM franchise at its cheapest valuation in 15 years. 6.5% FCF yield, net cash balance sheet, <5% churn. The Feb 11 crash (-21%) was the worst in company history. NVIDIA partnership is a credible AI hedge. **Catalyst: Q1 2026 earnings April 23.** Caveat: Q1 guided negative (-2% to -6%); this is a 12-24 month thesis. Position: half now, half post-Q1.

8. **6098.T (Recruit Holdings)** — 62% confidence. Record EPS guided (335 yen, +23% YoY). 1T+ yen in buybacks over 2 years. Fortress balance sheet (12% D/E). The AI disruption of job boards is real but 2/3 of Indeed's revenue is blue-collar/healthcare hiring which is AI-resistant. **Catalyst: FY2025 results May 2026.** Position: half-position, add at 5,200-5,500 if macro deteriorates.

**WAIT & SEE (monitor for catalysts before entry):**

1. **BC8.DE (Bechtle)** — 60% confidence. Two consecutive years of earnings decline. Low-margin IT reseller model faces structural cloud disintermediation. PEG of 3.7x is expensive for 5% growth. However, EUR 2.7B order backlog (+11% YoY) and German digitalization tailwinds provide a floor. **Wait for: March 20 earnings and 2026 guidance.** If guidance shows 5%+ EBT growth, enter. If not, pass.

### If Forced to Pick One Right Now

**CRM (Salesforce)** at $184.29 with 72% Asymmetric Opportunity confidence.

The math is compelling:
- **$15B annual FCF** at a 12x FCF multiple — the cheapest Salesforce has ever been as a profitable company
- **Margins expanding**: 30.5% → 33.0% → 35.5% EBIT over 2 years
- **Agentforce** at $500M+ ARR growing 330% — the very AI product the market fears will destroy SaaS is what Salesforce is building
- **$5.6B U.S. Army IDIQ contract** secured January 2026
- **RSI 25.4** — deeply oversold after the Feb 3 SaaSpocalypse
- **Earnings in 7 days** (Feb 25) — with a beat-and-raise scenario, the oversold setup could produce a violent snapback

The key risk is the AI seat compression thesis — that enterprises will need fewer SaaS licenses as AI agents automate human tasks. This is a real 3-5 year risk but is not yet showing up in any reported metric. At 15x forward P/E with $15B in FCF, you are being compensated for that risk.

**Position sizing: 50% of intended allocation now; 50% after the Feb 25 earnings reaction.**

**Comparison to yesterday's pick:** Yesterday, the pessimist test said "Nobody" and reluctantly pointed to 6098.T at 42% Wait & See. Today, the based test identifies CRM at 72% Asymmetric Opportunity as a genuine conviction buy. The difference is that the based test evaluates the data objectively rather than searching for reasons to reject the trade. Both perspectives have value — the pessimist test's thesis killers (AI disruption, seat compression) are real risks that should inform position sizing, not prevent entry entirely.

**Bottom line: The February 2026 SaaSpocalypse has created the most attractive entry points in enterprise software since the COVID crash. The based stress test confirms that the sell-off is sentiment-driven, not fundamentals-driven, for the highest-quality names.**

## Individual Stress Test Reports

<details>
<summary>CRM — Salesforce (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) — $184.29

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 25.4 | P/E 24.6 | ROE 12.2% | D/E 19%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 70% temporary / 30% structural. The SaaSpocalypse of Feb 2026 (triggered by Anthropic's Claude Cowork release) erased $800B+ across the software sector. CRM's actual fundamentals improved: Q3 revenue $10.26B (+8.6%), EPS beat ($3.25 vs $2.86 est), Agentforce ARR $500M+ (330% growth), margins expanding to 35.5%. The "seat compression" AI thesis is real but speculative — not yet in any reported metric.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bear: seat compression materializes, Microsoft bundles Dynamics at zero marginal cost, Agentforce fails, CRM becomes IBM of CRM at 8-10x. Bull: 200K+ enterprise customer base becomes insurmountable AI distribution moat, Agentforce becomes dominant enterprise AI agent platform, FCF crosses $25B by 2029, shares bought back at depressed valuations. Bull is more probable (60/25/15 bull/muddle/bear) — dominant enterprise platforms with 20%+ market share historically adapt.

3. **Moat Integrity:** Strong in enterprise (switching costs: 12-24 months, millions in migration), weak in SMB/mid-market (HubSpot, Dynamics 365 compete on price). A 10% price increase would be absorbed by Fortune 500 but accelerate mid-market churn. vs Microsoft Dynamics: most dangerous competitor due to bundling. vs HubSpot: stealing the SMB pipeline.

4. **Valuation Reality:** Forward P/E ~15x is the lowest in CRM's history as a profitable entity. 40% discount to Salesforce's own 3-year average. Cheapest large-cap enterprise SaaS by a wide margin. The "E" is expanding: FY24 NI $4.14B → FY25 $6.20B → FY26 tracking $7.22B. Not deteriorating.

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** FCF/NI ratio: 2.29x (FY24), 2.01x (FY25), ~1.88x (FY26). Outstanding. $15B+ projected FCF in FY26. At $184, CRM trades at ~12x trailing FCF for a company growing FCF 20%+.

6. **Smart Money:** Director David Kirk bought $500K+ at $258.64 (Dec 2025) — 40% above current price. Institutional flows mixed: Harris Associates, Balyasny, AQR accumulating. No aggressive insider buying at current levels, but C-suite may be in blackout ahead of Feb 25 earnings.

7. **Catalysts:** (1) Q4 FY2026 earnings Feb 25, 2026 — 7 days away. Beat + raise with strong Agentforce metrics = potential violent short squeeze at RSI 25.4. (2) U.S. Army $5.6B IDIQ contract task order flow Q2-Q4 2026.

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "Legacy SaaS vendor, seat compression, Agentforce is a rounding error ($500M on $41B), Microsoft bundles at zero cost." Activist: "$15B FCF at 12x, margins expanding, cheapest ever, 200K enterprise customers = AI distribution moat, buybacks alone drive 8-10% EPS growth in zero-revenue-growth scenario." **Activist wins — bull thesis is built on current data; short thesis is built on forward speculation.**

9. **Verdict:** ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITY at 72% confidence. The risk/reward is skewed favorably. Position 50% now, 50% post-Feb 25 earnings. Monitor Agentforce ARR trajectory — if it accelerates past $1B ARR in FY27, bull thesis validated.

<summary>ADBE — Adobe (Asymmetric Opportunity, 65%)</summary>

### Adobe Inc. (ADBE) — $260.45

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 28.4 | P/E 15.6 | ROE 55.4% | D/E 57%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 55% temporary (AI fear overdone, Adobe adapts) / 30% structural (AI tools commoditize creative workflows) / 15% accelerating decline. Down 44% from 52-week high. Goldman downgraded to Sell. But: FY2025 NI $7.13B (+28%), FCF $9.85B (+25%), 41% FCF margins.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bear: AI-native tools make Creative Cloud obsolete for 80% of use cases; becomes digital utility at 10-12x. Bull: Firefly IP-safe AI + enterprise trust = dominant AI creative platform; FCF crosses $15B+; stock $600-800. Bull moderately more probable (55/45).

3. **Moat Integrity:** Enterprise: very high switching costs (file formats, plugins, muscle memory). A 10% increase would be absorbed. Prosumer/SMB: significant churn risk to Canva ($120/yr vs CC $660/yr). vs Canva: competes on price, low switching cost. vs Figma: owns UI/UX, medium lock-in. Adobe is the only full-stack creative suite.

4. **Valuation Reality:** 15.6x trailing P/E is 58-66% below 10-year average (~45x). 40% discount to Salesforce despite better margins. Forward P/E ~11x. This is the cheapest Adobe has been in over a decade.

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** FCF/NI: 128% (FY23), 142% (FY24), 138% (FY25). Elite. $9.85B FCF on $23.8B revenue with <1% capex intensity. The cash is real and growing.

6. **Smart Money:** CFO Daniel Durn bought $508K (March 2025). CLO Adele Pentland bought $12.5M (June 2025) — real money C-suite conviction. Gotham Asset Management (Greenblatt) boosted 190%. But: 982 institutions added vs 1,602 decreased — net selling. Short interest at 8-year high.

7. **Catalysts:** (1) Q1 FY2026 earnings March 11, 2026. (2) Semrush acquisition close ($1.9B) H1 FY2026.

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "Canva 230M MAUs, Figma 38% growth, AI commoditizes creative work — Kodak in 2005." Activist: "15.6x P/E on 55% ROE + 41% FCF margins + $25B buyback = heads-I-win-tails-I-don't-lose. Re-rate to 20x = $330 (+27%), to 25x = $415 (+59%)." **Activist wins — the math overwhelms the narrative at these levels.**

9. **Verdict:** ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITY at 65% confidence. The narrative trap (AI kills Adobe) is not supported by the financial data. Starter position (25-30%), add post-March 11 earnings. Key line: if ARR growth decelerates below 9%, reassess.

<summary>EVD.DE — CTS Eventim (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### CTS Eventim AG (EVD.DE) — €64.65

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 26.6 | P/E 21.6 | ROE 29.7% | D/E 11%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 75% mispricing / 15% structural / 10% value trap. Down 43% from 52-week high of €114.10. The selloff was triggered by a CFO appointment (Nov 2025), not fundamental deterioration. Revenue grew 19.1% in FY2024. 9M 2025 revenue +6% YoY. 19th record year since IPO.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bull: expands into UK (See Tickets), Italy (Arena Milano), potentially US post-Ticketmaster antitrust. EBITDA margins expand to 55%+. Revenue doubles to €5.5-6B. Target €180-220. Bear: EU recession, fee caps, tech disruptor disintermediates. Revenue stagnates. Target €25-35. Bull more probable — live entertainment market CAGR ~5.9% through 2030.

3. **Moat Integrity:** Wide and intact. Exclusive venue contracts, venue ownership (Arena Milano), dynamic pricing, and regulatory capture create deep switching costs. Ticketing EBITDA margin ~47% vs Live Nation ~25-30%. vs Live Nation: stronger vertical integration, but 99-115x P/E vs Eventim 21x (!). vs Eventbrite: no comparison (commoditized, low-margin).

4. **Valuation Reality:** 21.6x P/E vs 10-year average 25.6x. Below historical mean for the first time since COVID. Live Nation at 99-115x — Eventim is one-fifth the multiple for the better business. Simply Wall St: 36.8% below fair value.

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** FCF/NI: 1.07x (FY22), 1.44x (FY23), 1.15x (FY24). Consistently above 1.0x. EUR 1.52B end cash. Arena Milano capex (EUR 180M) was growth capex, now complete. Normalization should boost FCF.

6. **Smart Money:** Founder-CEO Klaus-Peter Schulenberg holds ~39-50% via KPS Foundation. Has not sold. Transfer to foundation signals multi-generational commitment. 25 analysts: unanimous Strong Buy. Average target €109.22 (+69% upside). Stock trades 41% below the LOWEST analyst target (€99).

7. **Catalysts:** (1) FY2025 earnings March 26, 2026. (2) Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics (Eventim is official ticketing partner + owns Arena Milano). (3) Ticketmaster DOJ antitrust trial March 2026.

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "21x with single-digit growth, European macro weakness, CFO transition, acquisition spending." Activist: "Europe's dominant ticketing platform, 30% ROE, EUR 1.19B net cash, 41% below lowest analyst target, RSI 26.6, founder with 40% stake hasn't sold, Live Nation at 99x." **Long pitch wins decisively — the magnitude of dislocation is disproportionate to the risks.**

9. **Verdict:** ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITY at 72% confidence. Downside limited by net cash (EUR 12.40/share = 19% of price), FCF yield 5-6%, dividend 2.5%. Upside to analyst consensus of €109 = +69%. Position: 50% now, 50% post-March 26 earnings.

<summary>BC8.DE — Bechtle (Wait & See, 60%)</summary>

### Bechtle AG (BC8.DE) — €32.66

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 20.5 | P/E 19.1 | ROE 11.2% | D/E 37%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 55% mispricing / 30% structural / 15% wrong timing. Down 28% from 52-week high. Two consecutive years of earnings decline (FY24 EBT -7.5%, FY25 EBT -6%). Q4 2025 pulled forward demand ahead of DRAM shortages. Management warned of supply constraints in 2026.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bull: German €102B digital roadmap + NIS2 cybersecurity mandates drive multi-year demand. Managed services pivot lifts margins. EBT recovers to €400M+. Target €75-80. Bear: cloud disintermediation erodes reseller model. German Mittelstand underinvests. EBT stagnates at €250-300M. Target €20-25. Most probable: muddle-through at 4-6% CAGR (30%).

3. **Moat Integrity:** Limited. IT reselling is low-margin (~2-3% operating) with low switching costs. Managed services have higher switching costs but Bechtle is not dominant there. vs Computacenter: better ROE (17.7% vs 11.2%) at comparable valuation. vs Cancom: lower quality. PEG ratio 3.7x — expensive for 5% growth.

4. **Valuation Reality:** 19x P/E is bottom quartile of 10-year range (13.6x-42.3x). Below median (21.9x) and mean (24.4x). Cheap vs history, fair vs peers, expensive on PEG. The discount reflects lower growth, not market inefficiency.

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** OCF/NI: 47% (2022), 173% (2023), 228% (2024). The 2022 was abnormally low (supply chain trapped cash); 2023-24 abnormally high (unwinding). Normalized FCF conversion ~80-100%. FCF yield ~5-6% at current price.

6. **Smart Money:** Schick-Krief family holds 33% (~EUR 1.8B). No reported insider selling. No insider buying either. Institutional ownership ~34%.

7. **Catalysts:** (1) FY2025 audited results & 2026 guidance March 20, 2026. Jefferies expects conservative 5-10% growth guidance. (2) NIS2 cybersecurity regulation implementation H2 2026.

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "Low-margin reseller, 2 years of earnings decline, PEG 3.7x, cloud disintermediation, Computacenter does it better." Activist: "EUR 2.7B order backlog, German digitalization tailwind, founder family 33%, 8-year low valuation, managed services margin inflecting." **Activist pitch more compelling near-term, but short pitch raises legitimate 5-10 year structural concern.**

9. **Verdict:** WAIT & SEE at 60% confidence (split: 35% Asymmetric, 45% Wait & See, 20% Value Trap). March 20 earnings will resolve the biggest uncertainty. If 2026 guidance shows 5%+ EBT growth, enter. If not, pass. Stop-loss at €28.

<summary>PUB.PA — Publicis Groupe (Asymmetric Opportunity, 68%) — NEW SIGNAL</summary>

### Publicis Groupe SA (PUB.PA) — €70.58

**NEW Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 27.5 | P/E 10.8 | ROE 15.5% | D/E 54%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 65% mispricing / 25% structural / 10% permanent impairment. Two compounding events on Feb 3: (A) FY2025 earnings — strong results (5.6% organic growth, 18.2% margin, EUR 2.03B FCF) but 2026 guidance of 4-5% disappointed (expected ~6%). (B) Sector-wide AI panic sell-off — Publicis -9.24%, Omnicom -11.15%, WPP -10.13% on the same day. Indiscriminate.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bull: AI becomes revenue amplifier via Epsilon data moat (2.3B consumer profiles) + CoreAI. Omnicom-IPG merger chaos = Publicis wins accounts. Margins expand to 20%+. FCF grows to EUR 2.5-3.0B. Multiple re-rates to 14-16x. 15-20% CAGR. Bear: AI platforms automate ad creation/media buying directly. EUR 17B in acquisitions become wasting assets. Organic growth turns negative. Stock to EUR 30. Bull 55%, Bear 30%.

3. **Moat Integrity:** Moderate. Epsilon data assets (2.3B profiles) provide differentiation, but Big Six agency share of US ad spending dropped from 44.6% (2019) to 29.6% (Q1 2024). vs Omnicom-IPG (merged): integration chaos, Publicis winning 2x as many pitches. vs WPP: -8.4% revenue decline, restructuring. Publicis is unambiguously the best-positioned holdco.

4. **Valuation Reality:** 10.8x P/E vs 10-year mean of 10.07x. Not screamingly cheap vs history. But: EV/FCF 12.3x = 8.1% FCF yield. Dividend yield 5.3% (well-covered at 50% payout). 14 analysts average target EUR 108.64 (+54% upside).

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** FCF/NI: ~130% (2023), ~123% (2024), ~107% (2025 headline). Consistently clean. FCF grew from EUR 1.70B to EUR 2.03B over 3 years. Capital allocation rational: EUR 950M dividends, EUR 175M buybacks, EUR 900M acquisitions.

6. **Smart Money:** Capital Group holds 16.58% — one of the world's most disciplined long-term investors. Wellington 5.40%. Marble Arch Investments 3.00% (activist — governance backstop). Net institutional buying of ~1.2M shares over last year. Company buying back shares under EUR 175M program.

7. **Catalysts:** (1) Q1 2026 revenue report April/May 2026 — if organic growth at upper end of 4-5% guidance, reverses narrative. (2) Omnicom-IPG integration stumbles = Publicis wins accounts (already demonstrated in 2025).

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "Best horse in the glue factory. Agency model structurally threatened by AI. Big Six share dropped 15pts in 5 years. EUR 17B in acquisitions become wasting assets." Activist: "8.1% FCF yield, 5.3% dividend, best margins in sector, RSI 27.5, AI sell-off was indiscriminate — Publicis -9% same day as WPP despite one growing 6% and the other declining 8%. 54% upside to analyst consensus." **Activist wins narrowly — hard numbers + asymmetric payoff (lose 20-30% but collect 15% dividends vs gain 40-60% + dividends).**

9. **Verdict:** ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITY at 68% confidence. The FCF yield and dividend provide a floor. Position: half now, half post-Q1 report.

<summary>DSY.PA — Dassault Systèmes (Asymmetric Opportunity, 65%)</summary>

### Dassault Systèmes SE (DSY.PA) — €16.73

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 23.5 | P/E 18.6 | ROE 13.3% | D/E 29%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 55% mispricing / 25% prolonged stagnation / 20% structural. Down 59% from 52-week high. Feb 11 crash of -21% (worst in company history) after Q4 revenue grew just 1%. License revenue -7%. 2026 guided 3-5%. Q1 2026 guided -2% to -6% (!). AlphaValue double-downgraded to Reduce.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bull: European auto cycle bottoms, Medidata inflects, NVIDIA partnership drives Virtual Twin monetization, subscription transition completes, margins expand. Stock EUR 55-70. Bear: AI commoditizes CAD/PLM, Medidata writedown, revenue growth 2-4%, stock EUR 10-14. Bull 50%, Bear 20%, Muddle-through 30%.

3. **Moat Integrity:** Strong but eroding at the margin. CATIA aerospace lock-in is one of the deepest moats in enterprise software (<5% churn). 270,000+ customers. 32% operating margins. But: ARR growth of 6% is "underwhelming" (Jefferies). vs PTC: outgrowing Dassault significantly (19% vs 4%). vs Siemens: Teamcenter Copilot AI integration.

4. **Valuation Reality:** 18.6x trailing P/E is less than half its 5-year average (~40x) and 10-year average (~43x). Cheapest in 15 years. Forward P/E ~12.8x. 6.5% FCF yield — unusual for a technology franchise. Net cash EUR 1.53B. S&P "A" rating.

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** FCF/NI: 125-130% (FY23), 130-135% (FY24), 115-125% (FY25). Consistently above 100% — hallmark of high-quality software. FCF ~EUR 1.4-1.5B. No cash flow problem; this is a narrative problem.

6. **Smart Money:** Dassault family (GIMD) holds ~40% capital, ~55% voting rights. Multi-generational holder since 1981. Charles Edelstenne ~6% personal stake. Yellow flag: no insider buying post-crash. Analyst consensus: 9 Buy, 8 Hold, 2 Sell. Average target EUR 26-31 (55-85% upside).

7. **Catalysts:** (1) Q1 2026 earnings April 23, 2026 — make-or-break for trough confirmation. (2) NVIDIA partnership Virtual Companions launch summer 2026.

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "Zero revenue growth in FY2025 (first since 2008). EUR 5B Medidata a value destroyer. 2029 ambition of 7%+ growth requires implausible acceleration. The 40x premium was never justified." Activist: "Monopoly-grade franchise, 270K customers, <5% churn, 32% margins, net cash, 15-year valuation low, 6.5% FCF yield. Dassault family owns 40% — multi-generational commitment. NVIDIA partnership = AI hedge. Stock doubles if P/E normalizes to 25x." **Activist pitch more compelling on the data, but patience required.**

9. **Verdict:** ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITY at 65% confidence. Half position now, second half after Q1 earnings (April 23) if results confirm trough. Hard stop at EUR 14. Target EUR 25-28 within 18-24 months.

<summary>PRX.AS — Prosus (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Prosus N.V. (PRX.AS) — €43.63

**Signal: Missed 0/5 | RSI 28.0 | P/E 9.0 | P/B 2.1 | ROE 26.0% | D/E 32%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 65% mispricing / 25% structural concern (Tencent concentration) / 10% deterioration. Down 33% from 52-week high. H1 FY2026 EPS missed by 25.6% (EUR 1.51 vs EUR 2.03 est), but miss was driven by lumpy Tencent gains, not operational weakness. E-commerce revenue +22%, e-commerce EBITDA +70%.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bull: Tencent reduced to 15% NAV, e-commerce generates $5B+ FCF, NAV discount compresses, buyback retires 50%+ of float. Target EUR 150-200 (13-17% CAGR). Bear: China regulatory crackdown, Tencent crashes, e-commerce fails, NAV discount widens to 50%+. Target EUR 20-25. Bull 60%, Bear 25%.

3. **Moat Integrity:** The moat is borrowed — 80% is Tencent's (WeChat monopoly). Own portfolio: iFood (narrow, Brazil market leader), OLX (moderate network effects), PayU (weak, competitive fintech). vs MercadoLibre: far cheaper but lacks operating purity. vs SoftBank: better discipline and lower leverage.

4. **Valuation Reality:** P/E 9x vs Dutch market average 18.1x. PEG 0.65. EV/EBITDA 7.5x. Buying $160B of Tencent for $93B — e-commerce portfolio valued at zero or negative. Headline P/E flatters due to Tencent equity-method income. But the buyback at 30% NAV discount creates 43 cents of value per dollar spent — mechanically accretive.

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** FCF trajectory: -$0.81B (FY22) → -$0.34B (FY23) → +$1.01B (FY24) → +$1.30B (H1 FY26). The inflection from negative to positive is the single most important data point. First time since IPO.

6. **Smart Money:** Insiders net sellers (mild negative). Corporate buyback: EUR 87.8M in early Feb 2026 alone. Since June 2022, buyback reduced float by 30%, returned $41B+. CEO Bloisi has EUR 100M bonus contingent on doubling market cap by June 2028 — extreme alignment (or extreme risk-taking incentive). 7 Buy, 2 Hold, 0 Sell. Average target EUR 64-68 (+50-60% upside).

7. **Catalysts:** (1) FY2026 full-year results June 2026 — if e-commerce guidance met ($7.3-7.5B revenue, $1.1-1.2B EBITDA), confirms inflection. (2) NAV discount compression / potential structural action (Naspers/Prosus collapse). Wildcard: China stimulus lifting Tencent.

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "80% NAV in one uncontrollable asset in an unpredictable jurisdiction. CEO selling Tencent to fund buybacks — cannibalizing the best asset. Insiders selling. Earnings miss." Activist: "Most mathematically obvious trade in Europe. $160B Tencent for $93B, $7B e-commerce portfolio for free, FCF inflecting positive, PEG 0.65, 30% float retired, CEO has $100M riding on closing the gap." **Activist wins on the math. Short correctly identifies the unhedgeable tail risk.**

9. **Verdict:** ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITY at 72% confidence. Position: 3-4% max (China concentration risk). Hard stop at EUR 33. Add on FY2026 results confirmation.

<summary>6098.T — Recruit Holdings (Asymmetric Opportunity, 62%)</summary>

### Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. (6098.T) — ¥6,327

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 29.8 | P/E 21.3 | ROE 27.3% | D/E 12%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 45% temporary / 35% partial structural / 20% full structural. Down 40% from 52-week high. Bloomberg headline today: "AI Threatens Staffing Industry as Companies Bring Recruitment In-House." Recruit itself laid off 1,300 (6% of HR Tech). But: raised FY2025 guidance to record EPS 335 yen (+23% YoY) and record revenue. Market sold the news.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bull: Indeed pivots from paid job ads to AI-powered "hiring operating system." Revenue per hire rises from $644 to $1,037 (Goldman estimate). Glassdoor integration creates unique bundle. Buybacks reduce shares 3-5%/yr. EPS reaches 500-600 yen. Target ¥12,500-15,000. Bear: AI-native competitors (LinkedIn Copilot) disintermediate Indeed. "Low hire, low fire" persists. Revenue per click declines AND volume declines. Target ¥3,000-4,500. Bull 40%, Bear 25%, Muddle 35%.

3. **Moat Integrity:** Mixed. Healthcare/essential-services hiring (2/3 of US revenue) has strong pricing dynamics — high-turnover, high-volume, Indeed's scale advantage matters. White-collar (~15%) vulnerable to LinkedIn. vs LinkedIn: most dangerous competitor (Microsoft/OpenAI integration). vs ZipRecruiter: weak, niche SMB.

4. **Valuation Reality:** 18-21x P/E vs 5-year average 35-40x. Cheapest in a decade. Analyst consensus target ¥10,130 (+65% upside). But still at a premium to Japanese market (median ~15x). Fair re-rated range: 18-22x at 335 yen EPS = ¥6,030-7,370.

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** FCF/NI: ~149% (FY22), ~108% (FY23), ~147% (FY24). Strong — FCF consistently exceeds NI. FY2024 FCF of ¥602B. Caveat: SBC of $410-570M USD narrows the gap. But even adjusted, cash generation is robust.

6. **Smart Money:** 1T+ yen in buybacks over 2 years. Management bought back at likely ¥8,500-9,500 average — current price is a significant discount. BlackRock holds significant stake. 12/12 analysts rate Buy. Zero sells.

7. **Catalysts:** (1) FY2025 full-year results May 2026. Record earnings delivery = proof AI disruption is premature. (2) US labor market inflection — when JOLTS rebound to 8M+, Indeed's revenue re-accelerates.

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "Legacy job board, AI disintermediation, Bloomberg says companies bringing recruitment in-house, paid job ads down, market selling despite strong earnings = the market sees something." Activist: "Most aggressive capital returner in Japanese corporate history. Record EPS guided. FCF of ¥600B+. RSI 29.8. Management bought at ¥8,500+; you buy at ¥6,100. 2/3 of revenue is blue-collar hiring — AI-resistant." **Activist has edge — short thesis overestimates white-collar exposure and ignores the blue-collar buffer.**

9. **Verdict:** ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITY at 62% confidence. Half-position entry. Add at ¥5,200-5,500. Hard stop at ¥4,800. Probability-weighted expected return: +17.6%.

<summary>0700.HK — Tencent (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) — HK$534.50

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 28.8 | P/E 21.2 | ROE 19.8% | D/E 32%**

1. **Falling Knife vs Mispricing:** 70% temporary / 15% structural / 15% permanent re-rating lower. Down 22% from Oct 2025 high. The "AI lag" narrative (Yuanbao 21M WAU vs Doubao 155M) + debunked VAT hike rumor + Yuanbao cash-burning promotion. But: Q3 2025 revenue +15%, operating profit +18%, margins 38%, international gaming +43%. The fundamentals are strong.

2. **Tail-Risk (10-Year):** Bull: WeChat's 1.4B MAUs = ultimate AI distribution moat. International gaming continues 40%+ growth. Regulatory environment stabilizes. AI monetization ramps across advertising, gaming, fintech. Buybacks reduce shares 15-20%. P/E re-rates from 21x to 30x. Target HK$2,000-2,500. Bear: CCP second rectification wave. US designation as Chinese Military Company triggers forced selling. ByteDance/DeepSeek displace AI ambitions. Target HK$300-400. Bull 40%, Base 35%, Bear 25%.

3. **Moat Integrity:** Strong. WeChat = operating system of Chinese digital life. 1.4B MAUs. 95% of Chinese consumers would switch phones rather than lose WeChat. Ad take rate rising (AI targeting drove +21% YoY ad revenue in Q3). ROIC > WACC for over a decade. Margins expanding to 38%. vs Meta: comparable margins, but Tencent at 21x vs Meta 28-30x. vs Alphabet: Tencent cheaper with better margin trajectory.

4. **Valuation Reality:** 21x P/E vs 10-year median 30x (30% discount to own history). Cheapest large-cap Comm Services name globally. PEG ~1.4x (below Meta ~1.5x, Alphabet ~2.2x). Morningstar's Ivan Su: top sector pick.

5. **Cash Flow Autopsy:** FCF: $28.4B (2023), $27.2B (2024), $24.3B (TTM Jun 2025). FCF/NI declining from 114% to 87% due to AI capex ramp (RMB 90B in 2025). Intentional investment, not deterioration. Cash reserves RMB 476B (~$65B). Fortress.

6. **Smart Money:** Pony Ma — no significant selling. Company buying back HK$80B+ in 2025 (following $100B in 2024). Prosus drip-selling (structural, mechanical, priced in — reduced from 29% to 23-24%). Bernstein, Morningstar, HSBC: Buy/positive. The company is the most aggressive buyer of its own stock.

7. **Catalysts:** (1) Q4/FY2025 earnings March 17-18, 2026 — 4 weeks away. With RSI 28.8, a beat = high-probability bounce. (2) AI monetization visibility Q2-Q3 2026 — if Yuanbao traction continues (already #1 on App Store), "AI lag" narrative collapses.

8. **Synthesis:** Short: "Chinese tech in an AI race it's losing. Yuanbao 21M vs Doubao 155M. Prosus structural seller. US DoD military designation June 2026. 4+ months of decline." Activist: "Cheapest large-cap Comm Services globally. 21x vs Meta 30x. 38% margins expanding. AI ad revenue already +21%. HK$80B buyback. RSI 28.8. Earnings in 4 weeks. The 'AI lag' narrative is a perception problem — the actual AI monetization data shows Tencent is winning." **Activist wins on the data — short relies on narrative that is contradicted by financial performance.**

9. **Verdict:** ASYMMETRIC OPPORTUNITY at 72% confidence. Position: 3-5% max (China political risk is unhedgeable). Expected return: +17% probability-weighted.
