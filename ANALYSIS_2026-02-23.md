# TL;DR

## What Changed Since Last Report (Feb 18 vs Feb 23)

| Change | Feb 18 | Feb 23 | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Signals (missed 0) | 9 | **5** | -4 signals lost (EVD.DE, 0700.HK, PRX.AS, PUB.PA recovered above RSI 30) |
| Near-misses (missed 1) | 104 | **107** | +3 near-misses gained |
| Stress tested | 9 | **6** | 5 signals + MSFT (nearest near-miss at RSI 32.4) |
| Asymmetric Opportunities | 8 | **3** | CRM, ADBE, MSFT |
| Value Traps | 0 | **0** | No value traps identified |
| Wait & See | 1 | **3** | BC8.DE, DSY.PA, 6098.T |

### Signal Composition Changes (Feb 18 → Feb 23)

| Stock | Feb 18 | Feb 23 | Why |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|
| **EVD.DE** | Signal (RSI 27.5) | Near-miss (RSI 36.4) | RSI recovered above 30 — DROPPED |
| **0700.HK** | Signal (RSI 28.1) | Near-miss (RSI 35.4) | RSI recovered above 30 — DROPPED |
| **PRX.AS** | Signal (RSI 29.8) | Near-miss (RSI 37.3) | RSI recovered above 30 — DROPPED |
| **PUB.PA** | Signal (RSI 27.5) | Near-miss (RSI 37.8) | RSI recovered above 30 — DROPPED |
| CRM, ADBE, BC8.DE, DSY.PA, 6098.T | Signal | **Signal** | Unchanged — still oversold |

**Key insight:** The SaaSpocalypse sell-off is stabilizing for some names (4 signals recovered), but the core enterprise software names (CRM, ADBE) and European/Japanese tech (BC8.DE, DSY.PA, 6098.T) remain deeply oversold. The sell-off has differentiated: companies with stronger narratives are bouncing while structurally cheaper names continue to compress.

### Recommendations

**AVOID:** None — no stock was rated Value Trap.

**WATCHLIST (Wait & See — monitor for catalysts before entry):**

1. **BC8.DE (Bechtle)** — 62% confidence. Record Q4 but supply chain warning. Two years of earnings decline need to inflect. Wait for **March 20** FY2025 results + 2026 guidance. Buy below €28-30 if guidance shows 5%+ EBT growth.

2. **DSY.PA (Dassault Systemes)** — 62% confidence. Down 55% from highs — cheapest in 15 years. But founder departed Feb 21, Q1 guided -2% to -6%. Wait for **April 23** Q1 2026 earnings for one clean quarter under new CEO Daloz.

3. **6098.T (Recruit Holdings)** — 62% confidence. Record EPS guided, 1T+ yen buybacks, 27.7% ROE. But US labor market frozen and AI disruption risk to Indeed. Wait for **May 7** FY2025 earnings and labor market stabilization signals.

**ACTIONABLE (Asymmetric Opportunities — favorable risk/reward setups):**

1. **CRM (Salesforce)** — 72% confidence. $12.9B FCF, 35.5% operating margins, Agentforce at $540M ARR (+330%). ValueAct added $25M at $260. **BINARY EVENT: Q4 earnings Feb 25 (2 days away).** Position: size small ahead of earnings, add on confirmed beat.

2. **ADBE (Adobe)** — 72% confidence. 15.5x P/E (cheapest in a decade), $9.85B FCF (+25% YoY), 41% FCF margins, 89% gross margins, $25B buyback. AI fear priced in but fundamentals haven't broken. **Catalyst: March 12 Q1 earnings.** Position: starter now, add post-earnings.

3. **MSFT (Microsoft)** — 72% confidence. Widest moat in enterprise software. 47% operating margins, 24% EPS growth, $77B TTM FCF. Near decade-low P/E of 24.8x despite accelerating earnings. **Catalysts: April Q3 earnings + July 1 M365 16% price hike.** Position: phase in over next 3 months.

### If Forced to Pick One Right Now

**MSFT (Microsoft)** at $397.23 with 72% Asymmetric Opportunity confidence.

The case:
- **Widest moat:** 400M+ paid M365 seats, 47% operating margins, monopoly-grade enterprise distribution
- **Cheapest in years:** 24.8x trailing P/E — 25% below 10-year average of 33x
- **Growing fast:** 17% revenue, 24% EPS growth, $625B commercial backlog (doubled YoY)
- **Pricing power proof coming:** July 1 M365 price hike (16% average) — if it sticks with minimal churn, the re-rating thesis is confirmed
- **No imminent binary event risk:** Unlike CRM (earnings in 2 days), MSFT's next catalyst is late April — time to build a position without gambling on a single print

The key risk is $144B annualized AI capex — if it fails to generate adequate returns, margins compress. But two-thirds is in short-lived assets (GPUs) that can be scaled back, and $136B operating cash flow covers it without leverage stress.

**Position sizing: 1/3 now, 1/3 at Q3 earnings (April), 1/3 post-July price hike confirmation.**

**Comparison to Feb 18 pick:** Feb 18 recommended CRM as the top pick with earnings 7 days out. That binary event is now 2 days away — the risk/reward on a pre-earnings bet has tightened. MSFT offers the same quality thesis with more time to build conviction and no imminent coin-flip.

## Individual Stress Test Reports

<details>
<summary>CRM — Salesforce (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) — $185.16

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 28.4 | P/E 24.7 | ROE 12.2% | D/E 19%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
60% temporary mispricing / 20% structural / 20% slow erosion. CRM is down ~42% from its 52-week high of ~$314. The SaaSpocalypse — a broad enterprise software selloff triggered by AI disruption fears — hit every SaaS name indiscriminately. CRM's actual financials are improving: 9% revenue growth, 35.5% operating margins (record), $12.9B FCF. Agentforce at $540M ARR growing 330% shows the company is monetizing AI, not being disrupted by it. The structural risk (AI seat compression reducing license count) is real but speculative — not yet visible in any reported metric.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: AI agents disintermediate the CRM application layer; Microsoft bundles Dynamics 365 for free; Agentforce fails. CRM becomes IBM of CRM at 10x earnings. Bull: 150K enterprise customers become insurmountable AI distribution moat; Agentforce dominates enterprise AI agents; FCF crosses $25B by 2030. Historically, large enterprise software platforms with deep workflow integration erode slowly (decades), not suddenly. Bull is more probable (60%).

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Strong in enterprise (switching costs: 12-24 months, millions in migration), weakening in SMB/mid-market. AppExchange ecosystem (7,000+ apps) and Trailhead community create gravity. Microsoft Dynamics 365 bundling is the most dangerous competitive threat. Moat grade: B+ (was A-).

**4. Valuation Reality:**
Forward P/E ~15-17x vs 5-year average ~35-40x. EV/FCF 13.5x. PEG 0.82. Genuinely cheap by every metric. The "E" is not deteriorating — margins at all-time highs, EPS growing 20%+. Even in bear case (6% growth, 33% margins), 7%+ FCF yield.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Pristine. FY2025 FCF $12.4B on $6.2B net income (2.0x conversion). FY2026 TTM FCF $12.9B. 30%+ FCF margins — best-in-class enterprise software. SBC ~$3-4B offset by aggressive buybacks ($50B authorized).

**6. Smart Money:**
Bullish. Director Kirk bought $500K+ at ~$260. ValueAct acquired another $25M at $260.58. Insiders not dumping. 80.4% institutional ownership.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **Feb 25 (2 days): Q4 FY2026 earnings.** Consensus $3.05 EPS, $11.18B revenue. 83% beat probability. Key: Agentforce metrics, FY2027 guidance.
- **3-6 months: Agentforce inflection.** If ARR crosses $1B+ and consumption revenue proves additive, the "SaaS is dead" narrative collapses.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: Legacy application wrapper, seat pricing is melting ice cube, Agentforce is a rounding error. Activist pitch: 13.5x EV/FCF, $12.9B FCF, 35%+ margins, insider buying, $50B buyback — world-class franchise at value-stock pricing. **Activist pitch is stronger** — the short thesis relies on a future that hasn't materialized in financials.

**9. Verdict: Asymmetric Opportunity (72%).** Position small ahead of Feb 25 earnings (binary event). Scale in on confirmed beat + strong guidance.

<details>
<summary>ADBE — Adobe (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Adobe Inc. (ADBE) — $258.61

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 29.1 | P/E 15.5 | ROE 55.4% | D/E 57%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
60% temporary (sector-wide SaaSpocalypse repricing) / 40% structural (AI commoditizing creative workflows). Down ~44% from 52-week high of $461. The business is not in decline: 10.5% revenue growth, 28% net income growth, 41% FCF margins. But Canva, Figma (80-90% UI/UX share), and AI-native tools are eroding the moat at the edges. Adobe abandoned XD, surrendering UI/UX entirely.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: AI tools make professional creative output accessible for near-zero cost. Creative Cloud churns from 26M to 18M subs. Revenue stagnates at $28B by 2030. Stock becomes IBM-like. Bull: Firefly becomes the "commercially safe" AI engine for enterprise creation (IP provenance moat critical as AI copyright litigation explodes). Experience Cloud + Semrush expands TAM by $15B. Revenue hits $40B by 2030. Bull is historically more probable (~60-65%).

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Strong in enterprise (proprietary formats: .PSD, .AI, .INDD; 90%+ retention; "commercially safe" AI content matters for regulated industries). Weak in prosumer/SMB (Canva handles 80% of non-designer needs). If prices rose 10%: enterprise stays, prosumers churn.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
P/E 15.5x vs 10-year average ~44-46x — 66% below average. Forward P/E ~11x (cheapest in its history). P/FCF ~10.8x. PEG 0.86. FY2025 EPS $16.70 with guided FY2026 EPS $23.30-$23.50. The "E" is expanding, not deteriorating. Revenue guided at 9.5% growth with margin expansion.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Exceptional. FY2025 FCF $9.85B on $7.13B net income (1.38x conversion). FCF margin expanded from 36% to 41% over 3 years. CapEx trivial ($179M on $24B revenue — less than 1%). Buyback $11.8B in FY2025 alone — largest in history. Net share count declining.

**6. Smart Money:**
Mixed individual insider signals but corporate buyback is screaming "undervalued" ($11.8B, 5%+ of shares). Norges Bank (Norway sovereign wealth) initiated $2B position. Goldman Sachs rare Sell rating at $290. Jefferies downgraded to Hold.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **March 12 (~3 weeks): Q1 FY2026 earnings.** Consensus $5.86 EPS, $6.28B revenue. Key: net new Digital Media ARR and AI revenue contribution.
- **April 2026: Adobe Summit.** Next-gen AI tools + Semrush acquisition close expected.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: Legacy SaaS monopoly facing existential AI disruption; Canva giving away tools for free; $25B buyback masking deteriorating organic growth. Activist pitch: 15x trailing earnings, 11x forward, $9.85B FCF, 41% FCF margins, 89% gross margins, 55% ROE — most mispriced large-cap tech stock. **Activist pitch stronger** — short thesis built on a future that hasn't materialized in financials.

**9. Verdict: Asymmetric Opportunity (72%).** 3-5% portfolio allocation. Stop-loss at $220. Add on clean March 12 earnings.

<details>
<summary>MSFT — Microsoft (Asymmetric Opportunity, 72%)</summary>

### Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) — $397.23

**Near-Miss: Missed 1/4 (RSI 32.4 — just 2.4 points above threshold) | P/E 24.9 | ROE 34.4% | D/E 32%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
75% temporary mispricing / 25% structural. Down ~26% from October 2025 ATH of $539.83. Three converging forces: (1) sector-wide software selloff (IGV ETF -23%+ YTD), (2) CapEx sticker shock ($37.5B Q2 capex, 66% YoY increase, ~$144B annualized), (3) Azure "deceleration" narrative (40% to 39% constant currency). Underlying business is accelerating: 17% revenue growth, 21% operating income growth, 24% EPS growth, $625B commercial backlog (doubled YoY).

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: AI capex is fiber-optic bubble 2.0. OpenAI (45% of $625B backlog) fails to achieve sustainable economics. Azure growth declines to single digits. "Vibe-coding" disrupts Office demand. Bull: AI platform shift plays out like cloud transition. Copilot expands from 15M to 200M+ seats. Azure becomes default enterprise AI layer at $250B+. July 2026 M365 price hikes (16%) stick. Bull is historically more probable (70/30) — Microsoft has navigated every major platform transition for 20 years.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Definitively wide and widening. July 1, 2026: 16% average M365 price increase — the live pricing power test. 400M+ paid seats deeply integrated into organizational workflows (Teams + SharePoint + Exchange + OneDrive + Copilot). Switching costs are enormous. Azure's integration with M365, Active Directory, and enterprise compliance creates additional friction. vs Apple: comparable consumer lock-in, weaker enterprise. vs Google: Workspace ~20% share vs MSFT ~50%+; Google Cloud less than half Azure's size.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
Trailing P/E 24.8x vs 10-year average 31.4-33.5x — 21-26% below average. Near the absolute bottom of its decade-long range (22.6x low). Forward P/E ~22.6x. Revenue growing 17%, EPS 24%, margins 47% and expanding. The "E" is sustainable and growing — operating cash flow $136B TTM comfortably funds capex.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Operating cash flow surging ($136B TTM, +37% YoY). FCF $77B — flat vs prior year because capex exploded from $25B to $64B+. This is deliberate reinvestment, not cash leakage. ~2/3 of capex is short-lived assets (GPUs) that can be scaled back. Margins 47% and expanding.

**6. Smart Money:**
Director John Stanton bought 5,000 shares ($1.99M) on Feb 18 at ~$397 — meaningful personal conviction. Institutional: Soros +159%, 3G Capital +157%, Vanguard +$7.7B, BlackRock +$4.9B. Sellers: Renaissance Technologies -48%, Gates Foundation -65%. 32 Buy / 4 Hold / 0 Sell analyst ratings. Avg target $593 (+49%).

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **Late April: Q3 FY2026 earnings.** Guidance $80.65-81.75B revenue. Key: Azure growth re-acceleration from 39% to 40%+ as capacity comes online.
- **July 1, 2026: M365 price increase (16% average).** If renewal rates hold, adds billions in high-margin recurring revenue. Definitively proves pricing power.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short pitch: $144B capex with no clear ROI path; 45% backlog tied to unprofitable OpenAI; Azure decelerating; capital destruction story. Activist pitch: Most entrenched enterprise platform in history at 25% discount to 10-year P/E; 17% revenue growth, 24% EPS growth; July price hike will prove pricing power; $397 will look absurd in hindsight. **Activist pitch stronger** — requires only that a company with the highest operating margins in big tech grows toward its historical average multiple.

**9. Verdict: Asymmetric Opportunity (72%).** Phase entry: 1/3 now, 1/3 at April earnings, 1/3 post-July price hike. The OpenAI concentration risk (45% of backlog) and unprecedented capex scale prevent higher confidence.

<summary>BC8.DE — Bechtle (Wait & See, 62%)</summary>

### Bechtle AG (BC8.DE) — €33.06

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 25.4 | P/E 19.3 | ROE 11.2% | D/E 37%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
75% temporary cyclical / 20% extended margin compression / 5% structural. Down ~25-30% in 3 months. Record Q4 2025 (EBT €121M, +20% YoY) but CEO warned of supply chain headwinds for 2026. DRAM shortage drove customers to pull-forward orders — risk of H1 2026 demand air pocket. Core business not broken: FY2025 volume +8% to €8.6B, gross margin improved 18.2% to 18.4%, international growth +17%.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: Hyperscalers go direct-to-customer, e-commerce segment (50% of revenue) margin erodes to near-zero, managed services fails to scale. Stock drifts to €15-20 at 8-10x. Bull: German/EU public sector digitalization (€34.2B federal funds) creates sustained tailwind. Bechtle's security clearances and 120 local offices make it the de facto government IT partner. Managed services reaches 40%+ of revenue at 15%+ margins. Revenue hits €10B+ under Vision 2030. Base case: moderate compounding (8-12% annualized).

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Narrow, sector-appropriate. IT e-commerce (hardware): zero pricing power, commodity business. IT System House & Managed Services: real switching costs, multi-year public sector framework contracts. vs Computacenter: stronger globally, weaker in DACH. vs CANCOM: fraction of the size.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
~19x trailing P/E vs 10-year median of ~22x. Cheapest since 2016-2017 outside COVID crash. But Computacenter trades at 16x with 17.7% ROE vs Bechtle's 11.2%. Earnings have declined 3 consecutive years (€266M → €245M → €215M). The "E" needs to inflect to justify buying here.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Surprisingly strong. FY2024 FCF €377M on €215M net income — 175% cash conversion. FY2022 was an aberration (inventory build). Balance sheet fortress: €616M financial liquidity.

**6. Smart Money:**
Neutral. Zero insider transactions recently. Founder family (Karin Schick-Krief) holds 33% — massive, aligned, long-term. No institutional panic.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **March 20: FY2025 audited results + 2026 guidance.** Market bracing for conservative 5-10% growth. If management surprises upside, stock re-rates. If weaker, breaks below €30.
- **H2 2026: German federal digitalization spending ramp.** €34.2B earmarked, Bechtle holds Bundeswehr/NATO contracts.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short: Low-margin hardware middleman; record Q4 inflated by pull-forward; 3 years of earnings decline; Computacenter is cheaper. Activist: Family-controlled fortress balance sheet generating €377M FCF; cheapest P/E since 2016; €34.2B German public sector digitalization spending about to flow through pipeline. **Activist pitch stronger long-term** but short thesis is valid near-term.

**9. Verdict: Wait & See (62%).** Wait for March 20. Buy below €28-30 if guidance is decent. Pass if guidance below 5% growth.

<summary>DSY.PA — Dassault Systemes (Wait & See, 62%)</summary>

### Dassault Systemes SE (DSY.PA) — €17.05

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 28.4 | P/E 18.9 | ROE 13.3% | D/E 29%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
60% cyclical mispricing / 25% execution risk / 15% structural. Down 55% over 12 months, 57% from 52-week high. The Feb 11 earnings "double miss" triggered a -20% single-day crash (worst in company history). Q4 revenue growth just 1% vs consensus 3%. 2026 guidance of 3-5% revenue growth below even bearish estimates. European automotive weakness (core vertical) and pharma pullback (Medidata -2% YoY) are cyclical. But cloud transition stalling at 6% ARR growth for 2 years is an execution concern.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: AI commoditizes PLM/CAD, switching costs drop, customers migrate to Siemens/Autodesk. Medidata never recovers. Revenue stagnates at €6.5B. Stock becomes a value trap at €12-15. Bull: 3DEXPERIENCE becomes the "OS for industrial digital twins." Firefly AI partnership with NVIDIA captures Fortune 500. Medidata dominates AI-powered clinical trials. Revenue hits €12B by 2033. Bull is historically more probable — dominant PLM platforms survive transitions.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Strong. The Daimler case: switching from CATIA to Siemens NX took 5 years, 6,000 employee retraining, supply chain disruption. 82% recurring revenue. Core CATIA/ENOVIA: 90%+ would stay on 10% price hike. SOLIDWORKS: 60-70% would stay. Medidata: 70-80%. vs Siemens PLM: ~22% market share, gaining in cloud. vs PTC: ~10%, narrower focus.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
P/E ~19.5x vs 10-year median ~53.4x — 63% compression. Forward P/E ~13.3x. This is 15-year valuation low. European Software sector average ~27x. Earnings quality high: 82% recurring, 32% operating margin, net cash €1.46B. Not a classic value trap (stable earnings, growing market). The risk is "dead money" if transition drags.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Excellent. FY2025 FCF ~€1.5B on €1.2B net income — 125% conversion. OCF margin 26%. CapEx modest. Net cash position €1.46B. No balance sheet distress whatsoever.

**6. Smart Money:**
Mixed. Bernard Charles stepped down as chairman Feb 21 (timing is unsettling — 2 weeks after worst earnings day ever). Company bought back shares on Feb 12-13 immediately post-crash (positive signal). Dassault family controls ~40% capital / ~55% voting rights — not selling.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **April 23: Q1 2026 earnings.** Q1 guided cautiously (revenue -2% to -6% YoY). If beaten + any stabilization signal, stock re-rates sharply.
- **H2 2026: Medidata/life sciences recovery.** If pharma clinical trial starts recover, Medidata inflects from drag to contributor.

**8. Synthesis:**
Short: Melting ice cube, 6% ARR growth for 2 years, license revenue -7%, founder abandoned ship, AI will commoditize PLM. Activist: #1 PLM franchise at 15-year low, 13x forward earnings, net cash, €1.5B FCF, 82% recurring revenue — spin off Medidata, accelerate buybacks, re-rate to €35-40. **Activist pitch structurally stronger** but family's 55% voting control makes intervention difficult.

**9. Verdict: Wait & See (62%).** Wait for April 23 Q1 earnings. Buy at €14-15 if it gets there (11x forward — extraordinary for this quality). Move to Asymmetric Opportunity on a Q1 beat + guidance reaffirm.

<summary>6098.T — Recruit Holdings (Wait & See, 62%)</summary>

### Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. (6098.T) — ¥6,284

**Signal: Missed 0/4 | RSI 29.5 | P/E 21.1 | ROE 27.3% | D/E 12%**

**1. Falling Knife vs Mispricing:**
65-70% cyclical / 30-35% structural. Down ~39% from 52-week high. US labor market in "low-hire, low-fire" freeze — Indeed Job Postings Index slid from 11.5% above pre-pandemic to 4.7%. JOLTS job openings fell to 6.5M. But Recruit's fundamentals are improving: FY2025 guidance raised to record revenue ¥3,664.7B, record EPS ¥335 (+23.4% YoY). US HR Tech revenue grew 5.8% despite 8% decline in job postings — extracting more revenue per posting.

**2. Tail-Risk Stress Test:**
Bear: AI platforms (OpenAI Jobs, LinkedIn AI) commoditize job matching to near-zero cost. Indeed's revenue-per-posting model collapses like classified ads. Japan staffing in secular decline from shrinking workforce. Bull: Indeed's unified data flywheel (behavioral + Glassdoor sentiment + employer relationships) creates the world's best AI matching engine. Shift to outcome-based pricing expands TAM 5x. EPS compounds 15-20% on buybacks. Bull has somewhat stronger historical backing (55%) — job boards have natural network effects unlike newspapers.

**3. Moat Integrity:**
Strong but narrowing. Indeed: 96.7% of US online job seekers, 615M profiles, 3.3M employers. Dominant in blue-collar/hourly/global (AI-resistant). Weak in white-collar/professional where LinkedIn dominates (87.8% in professional recruitment). CareerBuilder + Monster bankruptcy removed competition. ZipRecruiter is a distant third.

**4. Valuation Reality:**
At ¥6,284 with guided EPS ¥335: ~18.8x forward P/E — cheapest in recent history (typical range 25-50x+). 27.7% ROE. Even in recession (EPS reverts to ¥250), 25x is not expensive historically.

**5. Cash Flow Autopsy:**
Excellent. FCF consistently exceeds net income (110-132% conversion). Low capex platform business. Net cash ¥563.5B. Over 1.3 TRILLION yen in buybacks over 18 months (>10% of market cap). Total payout ratio ~159%.

**6. Smart Money:**
Neutral-to-positive. CEO Idekoba took on Indeed CEO role directly (personal commitment signal). BlackRock, Sumitomo Mitsui, Nomura hold significant positions. Goldman upgraded. Massive corporate buyback is the strongest "insider buying" signal.

**7. Catalyst Calendar:**
- **May 7: FY2025 full-year earnings.** If delivered at or above guidance + constructive FY2026 outlook, stock could re-rate sharply.
- **Q2-Q3 2026: US labor market inflection.** Indeed data shows job postings "increased slightly" recently. If hiring thaws, Indeed's operating leverage is enormous (10% posting increase → 15-20% profit increase given restructured cost base).

**8. Synthesis:**
Short: Cyclical staffing disguised as tech; Indeed faces existential AI disruption; 3 years of layoffs prove broken model. Activist: World's largest job platform, record EBITDA with expanding margins, 27.7% ROE, 10%+ of market cap in buybacks at depressed prices. **Activist pitch structurally stronger** — labor market will eventually thaw, and the short thesis on AI displacing job boards is unproven.

**9. Verdict: Wait & See (62%).** Strong lean toward Asymmetric Opportunity at the stated price. Wait for May 7 earnings and US labor market signals. Build half-position if macro stabilizes, add at ¥5,200-5,500 if it dips further.
